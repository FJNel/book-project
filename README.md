# The Book Project

The Book Project is a personal project that is currently under development. I got the idea for this project when a friend of mine showed me how he was using an Excel Spreadsheet with manual calculations to manage his book collection. As a Computer Science student, I was horrified by the idea of using such an outdated and inefficient method to manage something as important as a book collection. So, I decided to create a web application that would make it easier for people to manage their book collections. 

While The Book Project is meant to be used by this friend, I also want to make it available to the public. I believe that there are many people out there who would benefit from a web application that makes it easy to manage their book collections. 

The Book Project is also a great Portfolio project for me. It allows me to showcase my skills as a developer and demonstrate my ability to create a web application from scratch. I hope to use this project as a stepping stone to more complex applications in the future.
