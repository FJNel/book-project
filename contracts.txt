B) Implementation Order Checklist
1. Modal Contract baseline
   - Why: modal structure and locking rules determine safe request handling and consistent error flows.
2. Changes Contract baseline
   - Why: change summaries depend on modal structure and must match modal validation/state rules.
3. Icon Contract
   - Why: icons are a visible UX contract; normalizing them avoids UI drift during later sweeps.
4. Interaction Contract
   - Why: interactions and hover rules build on the modal/icon baselines and must align with them.

C) Reference rule
- When a page differs intentionally from the reference implementation, the deviation must be documented in contracts.txt and applied consistently.

A) Modal Contract (Book Project standard)
----------------------------------------
Applies to any modal that accepts user input, performs a server action, or confirms a destructive change.

1) Live validation
- Each field has help text below it.
- Help text has two states:
  - Neutral guidance: class "form-text text-muted" (e.g., format hints).
  - Validation error: class "form-text text-danger" (e.g., "This field is required.").
- Validation runs on input/change and on submit.
- Field validity rules:
  - Required fields are valid only when trimmed value is non-empty and passes any format rules.
  - Optional fields are valid when empty OR valid per format rules.
  - Date fields use the partial date parser; invalid input is invalid.
- Field visual state:
  - When invalid: add "is-invalid" to the input/select/textarea; show error help text.
  - When valid and non-empty: add "is-valid" (optional if the UI already avoids green validation); clear error help.
  - When empty and optional: no validation classes, neutral guidance only.
- Never include green fields or checkmarks for valid fields in modals. If the field is valid, no visual indication is needed, and the help text should absent (empty).

2) Primary action enable/disable rules
- Primary action is disabled until:
  - all required fields are valid, AND
  - there is at least one meaningful change from the original values,
    OR (for confirm-only modals) the confirmation requirement is satisfied.
- Confirm-only modals (type-to-confirm):
  - Required phrase is shown in the modal (e.g., DELETE).
  - Input is trimmed and compared case-insensitively.
  - The primary button is enabled only when the phrase matches.
- High-risk admin deletion confirmations must use multi-field confirmation:
  - typed user email
  - typed user ID
  - typed confirmation phrase

3) Request locking
- When a request is in flight:
  - inputs, selects, textareas, and all buttons are disabled (including close buttons),
  - modal cannot be closed (static backdrop + keyboard disabled),
  - the primary button shows a spinner.
- Use the shared modal lock helper (window.modalLock) where available.

4) Success + error outcomes
- On success:
  - modal closes by default,
  - UI updates in place (avoid full-page reload when feasible),
  - show inline success alerts when the flow stays on the same page.
- On error:
  - modal remains open,
  - show a standard alert:
    "<strong>API message</strong>: errors joined"
  - errors are rendered safely (no HTML injection; use renderApiErrorAlert or textContent).

5) Logging
Minimum console logs per modal:
- [Feature][Modal] opened
- [Feature][Modal] validation state changed (optional)
- [Feature][Modal] request started
- [Feature][Modal] request finished (success)
- [Feature][Modal] request failed with status/message

B) Changes Contract (applies to edit/change modals)
---------------------------------------------------
This is the standard "Changes" summary area for edit/change modals.

1) Placement + appearance
- Always placed at the bottom of the modal content, directly above the footer.
- Uses a stable container (no layout shift), e.g.,
  - <div class="small text-muted" id="...">No changes yet.</div>

2) Empty state
- When nothing differs from original values: "No changes yet."

3) Change phrasing rules (old → new)
- Each change is a full human-readable sentence.
- Consistent patterns:
  - "Changing title from 'Old' to 'New'."
  - "Changing preferred name from 'Johan' to 'Johan Nel'."
  - "Clearing subtitle (was 'Old')."
  - "Adding language: Afrikaans."
  - "Removing publisher (was 'Penguin')."
- Use single quotes around values. Use title case only where it belongs in the original value.

4) Date display rules
- Dates in the changes summary must use the normalized display format (not raw input).
- Use the same partial-date normalization rules used elsewhere in the app.
  - Example: user input "12/3/2023" → display "12 March 2023".

5) Null/empty behavior
- Field becomes empty: "Clearing <field> (was '<old>')."
- Field was empty and becomes filled: "Adding <field>: '<new>'."
- Field remains empty: no change entry.

6) Multi-item changes
- For tags/languages/authors lists:
  - Adds: "Adding tags: A, B, C." (list each item; if more than 6, show first 6 + "and N more").
  - Removes: "Removing tags: A, B." (same list rule).
  - Reorders (if applicable): "Reordering tags." (do not list every move).

These contracts are the single source of truth for modal behavior and edit/change summaries in the Book Project.

A1) Shared add modals (shared-add-modals.js)
--------------------------------------------
Purpose: keep shared add/edit modals consistent across pages and prevent one-off modal drift.

1) Canonical implementation
- Source of truth: `web/assets/js/shared-add-modals.js`.
- The shared modal host must be present in the page: `<div id="sharedAddRecordModals"></div>`.
- Modal markup is injected into the host; pages must not duplicate that markup.

2) Usage rules
- If a shared modal exists for a concept, all pages must use it via:
  `window.sharedAddModals.open('<type>', { mode: 'add'|'edit', initial: { ... } })`.
- Pages must not implement alternate add/edit modals for the same concept.
- Any shared modal behavior change is a contract-level change and must be tested across all consumers.

3) Covered concepts (current)
- Book Type, Author, Publisher, Series, Storage Location.

4) Reference consumers
- `web/book-details.html` + `web/assets/js/book-details.js` (baseline consumer).
- `web/book-types.html` + `web/assets/js/book-types.js` (Book Type add).
- `web/book-type-details.html` + `web/assets/js/book-type-details.js` (Book Type edit).

C) Icon Contract (Bootstrap Icons font)
--------------------------------------
Purpose: standardize icon usage across user + admin UI to prevent drift and keep interactions consistent.

1) Canonical markup + source of truth
- Use Bootstrap Icons font classes only: `<i class="bi bi-..."></i>`.
- Inline SVG icons are not allowed in Book Project UI.
- Do not mix icon sets. If a new icon is required, add it to this contract first.
- Icon-only buttons must keep an accessible label (aria-label or tooltip/title).
- Whitelisted exception: vendor assets under `api/docs/swagger-ui/` may contain inline SVG; do not modify vendor bundles.

2) Canonical mappings (Action/Concept → Icon class → Where used → Notes)
- Add → `bi bi-plus-square` → Add buttons across pages → Use for create/add actions.
- Edit → `bi bi-pencil-fill` → Edit buttons, manage icons → Use for edit/update actions.
- Delete → `bi bi-trash-fill` → Delete/permanent delete → Use only for destructive deletion.
- Remove → `bi bi-x-square` → Remove from list/relationship → Not for permanent deletion.

- Disable account → `bi bi-person-x-fill` → Account danger zone → Disable account.
- Enable account → `bi bi-person-check-fill` → Account admin enable → Enable account.
- API/DB Healthy → `bi bi-cloud-check` → Admin status → Healthy service state.
- API/DB Unhealthy → `bi bi-cloud-slash` → Admin status → Unhealthy service state.
- AI features → `bi bi-stars` → AI helper labels → Use only where AI assistance is described.
- Favourite (outline) → `bi bi-star` → Favourite toggle → Use when not selected.
- Favourite (filled) → `bi bi-star-fill` → Favourite toggle → Use when selected.
- Android → `bi bi-android` → Device indicators → Account sessions.
- Apple → `bi bi-apple` → Device indicators → Account sessions.
- Windows → `bi bi-windows` → Device indicators → Account sessions.
- Mac → `bi bi-command` → Device indicators → Account sessions.
- Linux → `bi bi-linux` → Device indicators → Account sessions.
- Phone → `bi bi-phone` → Device indicators → Account sessions.

- Series → `bi bi-collection-fill` → Dashboard + nav → Series feature card.
- Storage Locations → `bi bi-diagram-3-fill` → Dashboard + nav → Storage Locations feature card.
- Statistics → `bi bi-bar-chart-line-fill` → Dashboard + stats pages → Statistics feature card.
- Move → `bi bi-arrows-move` → Move actions → Storage locations move.
- Copy (outline) → `bi bi-clipboard` → Copy actions → Copy before success.
- Copy (done) → `bi bi-clipboard-check` → Copy actions → Show after success.
- Info tooltip → `bi bi-info-circle` → Form help tooltips → Inline next to labels.
- Restore → `bi bi-arrow-counterclockwise` → Restore from recycle bin → Soft-delete restore.
- View details → `bi bi-eye` → Row action “View” → Used in Book Types list.
- Pagination previous → `bi bi-arrow-left` → Pagination controls → Previous page.
- Pagination next → `bi bi-arrow-right` → Pagination controls → Next page.

- Tree expanded → `bi bi-chevron-down` → Tree rows → Storage locations expanded state.
- Clear → `bi bi-x` → Clear actions → Clear search/filter buttons.

3) Consistency rules
- Same action must use the same icon across user + admin surfaces.
- Use the same icon for the same concept in all pages.
- Do not change icon classes for a page without updating this contract and all related pages.

4) Behaviour notes
- Favourite icons: use `bi bi-star` for off, `bi bi-star-fill` for on.
- Copy icons: use `bi bi-clipboard` before copy, switch to `bi bi-clipboard-check` on success.

5) Adding new icons
- Confirm no existing icon fits the concept.
- Add the new icon to this contract with usage notes and affected pages.
- Update all relevant pages in the same change to prevent drift.

D) Interaction Contract (lists + tables)
----------------------------------------
Purpose: standardize list/table interactions across the app to ensure consistent hover, keyboard, and row-action behavior.

1) Scope + baseline
- Applies to list tables, card lists, and any "clickable row" list UI.
- Baseline implementation: Books page.
  - Reference: web/books.html, web/assets/js/books.js
- Additional reference pages (must match baseline unless documented):
  - web/book-types.html, web/assets/js/book-types.js
  - web/authors.html, web/assets/js/authors.js
  - web/publishers.html, web/assets/js/publishers.js
  - web/series.html, web/assets/js/series.js
  - web/storage-locations.html, web/assets/js/storage-locations.js
  - web/statistics.html, web/assets/js/statistics.js
  - web/admin-library.html, web/assets/js/admin-library.js
- web/author-details.html, web/assets/js/author-details.js
- web/publisher-details.html, web/assets/js/publisher-details.js
- web/series-details.html, web/assets/js/series-details.js
- web/book-details.html, web/assets/js/book-details.js
- Admin user directory row-click details modal:
  - Reference: web/admin.html (User Details Modal), web/assets/js/admin.js (Users table row click)
  - Rule: row click opens the user details modal with actions; actions inside the modal must follow Modal + Icon Contracts.

2) Clickable row markup
- Use the `clickable-row` class on any row/list item that is clickable.
- For navigation rows, add `data-row-href="..."` and set:
  - `tabindex="0"`
  - `role="link"`
- For non-navigation row actions (no URL), use `data-row-action="..."` and:
  - `tabindex="0"`
  - `role="button"`
- If row text is not descriptive, add `aria-label` that matches the primary action.

3) Pointer + hover rules
- Clickable rows: cursor must be pointer and hover background must be visible.
- Non-clickable rows: no pointer cursor and no hover styling that implies click.
- Hover and focus-visible backgrounds must not cause layout shift.

4) Event propagation rules
- Row click handlers must ignore interactions on controls:
  - Ignore clicks originating from `button`, `a`, `input`, `select`, `textarea`, or any element with `data-row-action` or `data-stop-row`.
- Row action buttons/links must call `event.stopPropagation()` to prevent row click.

5) Hover/focus-within parity for row actions
- Any action controls shown on hover must also appear on `:focus-within`.
- Use a stable container with `row-actions` class and keep layout fixed:
  - right-aligned
  - `white-space: nowrap`
  - fixed/min width so columns do not jitter

6) Keyboard interaction + accessibility
- Clickable rows must be tabbable and activate on Enter/Space.
- Action buttons must be tabbable and keep meaningful `aria-label` and/or tooltip text.
- Focus styling must remain visible and theme-aware.

7) Touch/no-hover rule + mobile exception
- On touch/no-hover devices, row actions must be accessible via focus-within.
- Project-specific exception: row edit/delete actions are intentionally hidden on mobile.
  - This is not a bug; it is a documented behavior for this project phase.

8) Loading/empty/error behavior
- Loading states must not leave rows clickable.
- Empty/error states must follow existing page patterns; do not add ad-hoc refresh buttons.
- Page loading modals/spinners must always close on success and error paths.
- Use global page loading modal only when the whole page is blocked (auth/session bootstrap, hard-gated multi-step startup, or blocking transitions).
- For list/lookup pages that can render in-place, use a standard in-page loading block in the results region:
  - spinner (`spinner-border text-secondary`)
  - loading message (for example, "Loading books…")
  - hide the block on both success and error paths.

E) Dark Mode Styling Rules
--------------------------
1) Theme-aware styling only
- No hard-coded light colors (e.g., #fff, #f8f9fa, "text-dark" used to force light-mode contrast, inline styles with background-color/color) unless explicitly theme-aware.
- Prefer Bootstrap theme variables/classes and project theme tokens.

2) Hover + focus behavior
- Hover/focus backgrounds must not cause layout shift or reduce contrast in dark mode.
- Use shared utility classes or theme tokens; avoid per-page ad-hoc hover colors.

3) Phase 0 scan findings (for later remediation)
- web/admin-library.html:24 - hover background-color: #f8f9fa (light-only hover state)
- web/series-details.html:24 - hover background-color: #f8f9fa (light-only hover state)
- web/author-details.html:24 - hover background-color: #f8f9fa (light-only hover state)
- web/publisher-details.html:24 - hover background-color: #f8f9fa (light-only hover state)
- web/storage-locations.html:25 - hover background-color: #f8f9fa (light-only hover state)
- web/book-details.html:40,50 - background-color: #f8f9fa in local styles
- web/book-details.html:293 - inline style background-color: #f7f8f9 on card
- web/admin.html:33 - color: #fff (hard-coded light text)
- web/account.html:50 - color: #fff (hard-coded light text)
- web/statistics.html:43 - color: #fff (hard-coded light text)
- web/assets/css/styles.css:2 - --bp-surface: #ffffff (verify theme override is applied in dark mode)
- web/assets/js/books.js:783-865 - text-bg-light + text-dark badges (forced light backgrounds)
- web/assets/js/book-details.js:842-942 - bg-light/text-dark/button class usage (forced light backgrounds)
- web/assets/js/storage-locations.js:407-580 - text-bg-light + text-dark badges (forced light backgrounds)
- web/assets/js/add-book-review.js:46 - bg-light text-dark badges (forced light backgrounds)

F) Modal Copy Library (Drafts)
------------------------------
1) No write permissions (draft)
- Title: "Read-only access"
- Body: "You are viewing this library in read-only mode. Edits are disabled."
- Primary button: "Close"
- Secondary button: (omit unless a help pattern already exists)
- Behavior notes:
  - Show when a disabled action is clicked in admin read-only context.
  - Button closes the modal; no side effects.

G) Emails Contract
------------------
Purpose: keep email templates consistent, auditable, and aligned with user expectations.

1) Required structure (all emails)
- Subject: clear and concise; matches the email's purpose.
- Greeting: personalized when available; otherwise neutral.
- Body: short paragraphs; one purpose per email.
- CTA (optional): one primary action when needed.
- Footer: must include the required support line (below).

2) Required support line
- Every email must include the line:
  "Did not expect this email? Contact support at support@fjnel.co.za."
- It must be a mailto link with a prefilled subject line: "Book Project support — {Email subject}".
- If a type-specific support address is required, it must still be a mailto link with a subject.

3) Essential vs optional emails
- Essential emails cannot be opted out.
- Must be essential (minimum):
  - Verification
  - Password reset / reset success
  - Account disable (including admin disable)
  - Account deletion verification / confirmation
- Usage notices (website/API) are account updates and must respect preferences.
- Optional emails must respect preferences (account updates, development updates).

4) Markdown rendering rules
- Markdown is allowed only for development update emails.
- Rendering must use the GitHub Markdown API proxy (admin preview and send pipeline).
- Rendered HTML must be sanitized before sending.

5) Drift prevention
- New templates must reference this contract.
- Any template change that alters structure/copy must update this section.

H) Terminology Audit: "entity/entities"
---------------------------------------
Table columns: Location | Context | User-facing? | Proposed replacement | Notes/risk

| Location | Context | User-facing? | Proposed replacement | Notes/risk |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| api/docs/swagger-ui/LICENSE:17 | Internal vendor license | No | "third parties" | Third-party license text; not rendered to users but keep vendor files untouched. |
| api/routes/import-export.js:525 | Internal code comment | No | "records"/"items" | Comment only; no UI impact. |
| api/routes/search.js:76 | Internal code comment | No | "records"/"items" | Comment only; no UI impact. |

OpenAPI/SwaggerUI audit notes:
- api/docs/openapi.yaml: no occurrences found in summary/description/examples/tags.
- SwaggerUI assets: LICENSE contains the term but does not render into the UI.

## I) Application Documentation Contract (VitePress docs-site)

Purpose: standardize all user-facing documentation under `web/docs-site/**` (Markdown compiled externally via VitePress) so guides remain consistent, accurate, and implementation-grounded. This contract follows the same “single source of truth” philosophy as other Book Project contracts. 

### 1) Scope + audience

* Applies to **all** `.md` files in `web/docs-site/`, including:

  * Guides (`/guides/**`)
  * Help pages (e.g., `/faq`)
  * Legal pages (e.g., `/legal/privacy-policy`)
  * The docs landing page (`/index`)
* Audience: **end users of the Book Project website** (not developers). Pages must describe how to use the **actual user-facing web app**, using exact UI language and flows. 

### 2) Grounding rule (no made-up behaviour)

* Documentation must be sourced from the **current implementation**:

  * Actual UI labels (button text, tab names, section headings)
  * Actual navigation paths
  * Actual modal titles/confirmations
  * Actual security/session behaviour and expiry
  * Actual limits (rate limits, request limits, token validity)
* If behaviour is not confirmed by the implementation, **do not document it**.
* If a doc needs a fact (e.g., expiry duration), the agent must confirm it in code/config first (frontend + backend where relevant), then document it. (Example of implementation-grounded approach already used in privacy/security docs.) 

### 3) Required writing style

* Tone: clear, neutral, instructional.
* Avoid: marketing language, speculation, roadmap statements, internal engineering detail.
* Prefer short paragraphs, concrete steps, and explicit outcomes.
* Use consistent product naming: “The Book Project”, “Book Project account”, “System Administrator”.
* No emojis.

### 4) Canonical page layout patterns

Documentation pages follow one of these standard patterns. Pick the **closest** matching existing pattern and keep structure consistent.

#### A) Standard “How-to” guide pattern (most guides)

Required order:

1. `# Title` (H1)
2. 1–3 sentence intro describing what the feature is and what the guide will help the user do. (See account/security guides.) 
3. One or more context sections as needed (H2):

   * `## When to ...` / `## Why ...` / `## What you need ...` (common in setup/security flows). 
4. `## Steps to ...` / `## How to ...` (H2)

   * Numbered steps (1., 2., 3.) with **exact** UI labels and navigation destinations.
   * Use full URLs only when pointing to public pages; otherwise prefer internal doc links for doc navigation.
5. Optional “Important notes” section(s) for security/limits/edge-cases:

   * Use blockquotes (`> ...`) for high-signal policies (expiry, rate limits, important warnings). 
6. `## Questions` (H2)

   * Each question is `### Question text` (H3) followed by a direct answer. (Used heavily in setup/security guides.) 
   * Questions are used extensively and must be used extensively in all relevant guides to address common confusions and edge cases, and rare questions that arise during implementation.
7. Horizontal rule line: `---`
8. `## What's Next?` (H2)

   * Short bridging paragraph (optional) + bullet list of related internal links.

#### B) Index / hub pages

* Provide a short intro and grouped link lists by category.
* End with `---` and a `## What's Next?` section with curated links. 

#### C) Placeholder/incomplete pages rule

* Placeholder pages may exist temporarily (e.g., “Managing Books/Authors”), but:

  * They must still follow the same headings and “What’s Next?” pattern.
  * They must not pretend to describe functionality that has not been verified.
  * They must be explicitly treated as incomplete until implemented and verified. 

### 5) Formatting rules

* Headings:

  * Exactly one H1 per page.
  * Use H2 for major sections; H3 for questions.
* Lists:

  * Use numbered lists for procedures.
  * Use bullet lists for reasons/options/definitions.
* Links:

  * Use internal doc links like `/guides/...` and `/legal/...` (as existing docs do). 
  * Prefer doc links over raw website URLs when referencing other documentation.
  * When linking to the product website (login/dashboard), use explicit URLs where it helps the user follow along. (Existing guides do this.) 
* Email links:

  * Use `mailto:` with a meaningful, prefilled subject in the query string (pattern used across account guides). 

### 6) UI-label fidelity (mandatory)

* Every step must reflect the UI as the user sees it:

  * Button text in quotes: `"Log Out"`, `"Request Password Reset"`, etc.
  * Tab names and section names exactly: `"Security"`, `"Danger zone"`, etc. 
* Do not paraphrase UI labels in procedural steps.

### 7) Behaviour and edge-case documentation

When a workflow has security or user-impacting edge cases, docs must include them:

* Redirect behaviour, session expiry, “already logged in” restrictions, etc. (Example: reset-password guide includes “already logged in” caveat.) 
* Rate limiting / abuse prevention notes must be included when implemented. 
* “We do not disclose whether an email exists” style privacy/security behaviour must be documented where relevant. 

### 8) Security and privacy statements (guardrails)

* Only state what is true in implementation.
* Avoid revealing sensitive internals (exact detection heuristics, secret values, internal admin tooling).
* Legal pages must remain grounded in real infrastructure and real data handling (see privacy policy style). 

### 9) “What’s Next?” section rules

* Must exist on every guide/help/legal page (unless explicitly exempted by this contract in the future).
* Must follow a horizontal rule `---` before it. (Consistent across docs.)
* Must include 3–6 relevant internal links, prioritizing:

  * The guide most likely needed after completing the current one
  * Security-related follow-ups for account actions
  * Closely related library management topics

### 10) Maintenance + drift prevention

* Documentation changes are treated like UI contract changes:

  * If UI copy/flow changes, docs must be updated in the same PR/commit set (or immediately after).
* Any new doc page must:

  * Follow the canonical layout patterns above
  * Reuse existing terminology and link conventions
  * Be verified against the current implementation before merge
* If docs conflict with implementation, the docs must be corrected (or the implementation updated if the docs represent the intended contract—explicitly decided and tracked).
