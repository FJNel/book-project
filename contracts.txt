  - Location: contracts.txt -> "D) Dark Mode Styling Rules"
  - Reference implementations: web/assets/css/styles.css, web/assets/js/common.js

B) Implementation Order Checklist
1. Modal Contract baseline
   - Why: modal structure and locking rules determine safe request handling and consistent error flows.
2. Changes Contract baseline
   - Why: change summaries depend on modal structure and must match modal validation/state rules.
3. Icon Contract
   - Why: icons are a visible UX contract; normalizing them avoids UI drift during later sweeps.
4. Interaction Contract (Phase 2 addition pending)
   - Why: interactions and hover rules build on the modal/icon baselines and must align with them.

C) Reference rule
- When a page differs intentionally from the reference implementation, the deviation must be documented in contracts.txt and applied consistently.

A) Modal Contract (Book Project standard)
----------------------------------------
Applies to any modal that accepts user input, performs a server action, or confirms a destructive change.

1) Live validation
- Each field has help text below it.
- Help text has two states:
  - Neutral guidance: class "form-text text-muted" (e.g., format hints).
  - Validation error: class "form-text text-danger" (e.g., "This field is required.").
- Validation runs on input/change and on submit.
- Field validity rules:
  - Required fields are valid only when trimmed value is non-empty and passes any format rules.
  - Optional fields are valid when empty OR valid per format rules.
  - Date fields use the partial date parser; invalid input is invalid.
- Field visual state:
  - When invalid: add "is-invalid" to the input/select/textarea; show error help text.
  - When valid and non-empty: add "is-valid" (optional if the UI already avoids green validation); clear error help.
  - When empty and optional: no validation classes, neutral guidance only.

2) Primary action enable/disable rules
- Primary action is disabled until:
  - all required fields are valid, AND
  - there is at least one meaningful change from the original values,
    OR (for confirm-only modals) the confirmation requirement is satisfied.
- Confirm-only modals (type-to-confirm):
  - Required phrase is shown in the modal (e.g., DELETE).
  - Input is trimmed and compared case-insensitively.
  - The primary button is enabled only when the phrase matches.

3) Request locking
- When a request is in flight:
  - inputs, selects, textareas, and all buttons are disabled (including close buttons),
  - modal cannot be closed (static backdrop + keyboard disabled),
  - the primary button shows a spinner.
- Use the shared modal lock helper (window.modalLock) where available.

4) Success + error outcomes
- On success:
  - modal closes by default,
  - UI updates in place (avoid full-page reload when feasible),
  - show inline success alerts when the flow stays on the same page.
- On error:
  - modal remains open,
  - show a standard alert:
    "<strong>API message</strong>: errors joined"
  - errors are rendered safely (no HTML injection; use renderApiErrorAlert or textContent).

5) Logging
Minimum console logs per modal:
- [Feature][Modal] opened
- [Feature][Modal] validation state changed (optional)
- [Feature][Modal] request started
- [Feature][Modal] request finished (success)
- [Feature][Modal] request failed with status/message

B) Changes Contract (applies to edit/change modals)
---------------------------------------------------
This is the standard "Changes" summary area for edit/change modals.

1) Placement + appearance
- Always placed at the bottom of the modal content, directly above the footer.
- Uses a stable container (no layout shift), e.g.,
  - <div class="small text-muted" id="...">No changes yet.</div>

2) Empty state
- When nothing differs from original values: "No changes yet."

3) Change phrasing rules (old → new)
- Each change is a full human-readable sentence.
- Consistent patterns:
  - "Changing title from 'Old' to 'New'."
  - "Changing preferred name from 'Johan' to 'Johan Nel'."
  - "Clearing subtitle (was 'Old')."
  - "Adding language: Afrikaans."
  - "Removing publisher (was 'Penguin')."
- Use single quotes around values. Use title case only where it belongs in the original value.

4) Date display rules
- Dates in the changes summary must use the normalized display format (not raw input).
- Use the same partial-date normalization rules used elsewhere in the app.
  - Example: user input "12/3/2023" → display "12 March 2023".

5) Null/empty behavior
- Field becomes empty: "Clearing <field> (was '<old>')."
- Field was empty and becomes filled: "Adding <field>: '<new>'."
- Field remains empty: no change entry.

6) Multi-item changes
- For tags/languages/authors lists:
  - Adds: "Adding tags: A, B, C." (list each item; if more than 6, show first 6 + "and N more").
  - Removes: "Removing tags: A, B." (same list rule).
  - Reorders (if applicable): "Reordering tags." (do not list every move).

These contracts are the single source of truth for modal behavior and edit/change summaries in the Book Project.

C) Icon Contract (Bootstrap Icons font)
--------------------------------------
Purpose: standardize icon usage across user + admin UI to prevent drift and keep interactions consistent.

1) Canonical markup + source of truth
- Use Bootstrap Icons font classes only: `<i class="bi bi-..."></i>`.
- Inline SVG icons are not allowed in Book Project UI.
- Do not mix icon sets. If a new icon is required, add it to this contract first.
- Icon-only buttons must keep an accessible label (aria-label or tooltip/title).
- Whitelisted exception: vendor assets under `api/docs/swagger-ui/` may contain inline SVG; do not modify vendor bundles.

2) Canonical mappings (Action/Concept → Icon class → Where used → Notes)
- Add → `bi bi-plus-square` → Add buttons across pages → Use for create/add actions.
- Edit → `bi bi-pencil-fill` → Edit buttons, manage icons → Use for edit/update actions.

3) Consistency rules
- Same action must use the same icon across user + admin surfaces.
- Use the same icon for the same concept in all pages.
- Do not change icon classes for a page without updating this contract and all related pages.

4) Behaviour notes
- Favourite icons: use `bi bi-star` for off, `bi bi-star-fill` for on.
- Copy icons: use `bi bi-clipboard` before copy, switch to `bi bi-clipboard-check` on success.

5) Adding new icons
- Confirm no existing icon fits the concept.
- Add the new icon to this contract with usage notes and affected pages.
- Update all relevant pages in the same change to prevent drift.

D) Dark Mode Styling Rules
--------------------------
1) Theme-aware styling only
- No hard-coded light colors (e.g., #fff, #f8f9fa, "text-dark" used to force light-mode contrast, inline styles with background-color/color) unless explicitly theme-aware.
- Prefer Bootstrap theme variables/classes and project theme tokens.

2) Hover + focus behavior
- Hover/focus backgrounds must not cause layout shift or reduce contrast in dark mode.
- Use shared utility classes or theme tokens; avoid per-page ad-hoc hover colors.

3) Phase 0 scan findings (for later remediation)
- web/admin-library.html:24 - hover background-color: #f8f9fa (light-only hover state)
- web/series-details.html:24 - hover background-color: #f8f9fa (light-only hover state)
- web/author-details.html:24 - hover background-color: #f8f9fa (light-only hover state)
- web/publisher-details.html:24 - hover background-color: #f8f9fa (light-only hover state)
- web/storage-locations.html:25 - hover background-color: #f8f9fa (light-only hover state)
- web/book-details.html:40,50 - background-color: #f8f9fa in local styles
- web/book-details.html:293 - inline style background-color: #f7f8f9 on card
- web/admin.html:33 - color: #fff (hard-coded light text)
- web/account.html:50 - color: #fff (hard-coded light text)
- web/statistics.html:43 - color: #fff (hard-coded light text)
- web/assets/css/styles.css:2 - --bp-surface: #ffffff (verify theme override is applied in dark mode)
- web/assets/js/books.js:783-865 - text-bg-light + text-dark badges (forced light backgrounds)
- web/assets/js/book-details.js:842-942 - bg-light/text-dark/button class usage (forced light backgrounds)
- web/assets/js/storage-locations.js:407-580 - text-bg-light + text-dark badges (forced light backgrounds)
- web/assets/js/add-book-review.js:46 - bg-light text-dark badges (forced light backgrounds)

E) Modal Copy Library (Drafts)
------------------------------
1) No write permissions (draft)
- Title: "Read-only access"
- Body: "You are viewing this library in read-only mode. Edits are disabled."
- Primary button: "Close"
- Secondary button: (omit unless a help pattern already exists)
- Behavior notes:
  - Show when a disabled action is clicked in admin read-only context.
  - Button closes the modal; no side effects.

F) Terminology Audit: "entity/entities"
