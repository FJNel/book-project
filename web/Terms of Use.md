# The Book Project Terms of Use

Last Updated: January 30, 2026

These Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern your use of The Book Project website at https://bookproject.fjnel.co.za and API at https://api.fjnel.co.za (the “Services”). By accessing or using the Services, you agree to these Terms.

## Acceptance of the Terms

By creating an account or using the Services, you confirm that you have read and agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Services.

## Description of the Services

The Book Project is a self-hosted personal library management application. The Services allow you to create and manage your personal library data (such as books, authors, publishers, series, tags, storage locations, and related notes), and to access your data through the web interface and API.

## Eligibility

You must be at least 13 years old to use the Services. You are responsible for ensuring that your use of the Services complies with applicable laws.

## Accounts and Authentication

- **Accurate information:** You must provide accurate, current information when creating or updating your account.
- **Credential security:** You are responsible for keeping your credentials secure and for all activity under your account.
- **Authentication methods:** The Services support email/password login and API keys. Google OAuth sign-in exists in the system but is currently disabled.
- **API keys:** If you create API keys, you are responsible for their security and for all requests made with those keys. Revoke keys you no longer need or suspect are compromised.

## User Responsibilities

You agree to:

- Use the Services lawfully and responsibly.
- Avoid abuse, excessive automated requests, or interference with the Services.
- Not attempt to bypass rate limits, security checks, or access controls.
- Not upload or link to content that you do not have the right to use or that violates applicable law.

## Library Content and User Data

- You retain ownership of the library data you create.
- You are responsible for the accuracy, legality, and appropriateness of the data you enter.
- The Services may reject data that does not meet validation or size limits.
- Import/export tools exist but have limited support and should not be relied on as your only backup.

## Admin Access and Moderation

Admin users may access and review user and library data for support, maintenance, troubleshooting, and operational reasons. Admins may modify, disable, or remove data or accounts when needed to protect the Services or to comply with operational requirements.

## Availability and Changes to the Service

- The Services are provided on a best-effort basis without uptime or availability guarantees.
- Features may change, be limited, or be removed at any time.
- The Services may be suspended or discontinued without prior notice.

## Data, Backups, and Loss

Encrypted daily backups are maintained and retained for up to 28 days. Backups reduce risk but are not a guarantee against data loss or corruption. You are responsible for keeping your own copies of important data.

## Third-Party Services

The Services depend on third-party providers for specific functions, including:

- Cloudflare (tunnel and edge access)
- Google (reCAPTCHA, OAuth sign-in, and Google Drive backups)
- Mailgun (email delivery)
- GitHub (Markdown rendering for certain admin emails)

Your use of those features is subject to the terms and privacy policies of those providers.

## Termination

- **User-initiated:** You may disable your account or request account deletion through the supported flows. Some deletion requests require confirmation and manual follow-up. Some deleted items go to a recycle bin and can be restored until you permanently delete them.
- **Operator-initiated:** We may suspend or terminate accounts for security, abuse prevention, legal compliance, or operational reasons.

## Disclaimers

The Services are provided “as is” and “as available.” We do not provide warranties of any kind, including warranties of availability, reliability, or fitness for a particular purpose.

## Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages, or for data loss, downtime, or loss of access arising from use of the Services.

## Changes to These Terms

We may update these Terms from time to time. Changes become effective when posted. The “Last Updated” date above reflects the latest revision.
