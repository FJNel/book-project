**Last updated:** January 30, 2026

This page answers common questions about The Book Project, how it works, and what you can expect when using it.

---

## General

**What is The Book Project?**  
The Book Project is a personal library app that helps you keep track of your books, authors, and related details in one place. It’s designed for private use, not as a public or social platform.

**Who is this for?**  
It’s for people who want a structured, detailed way to manage their own book collection - whether that’s a few shelves or a large personal library.

**Is this a commercial product?**  
No. The Book Project is not a commercial service and does not come with uptime or support guarantees.

**Is this a social or shared library platform?**  
No. Your library is private to your account unless an admin needs access for support or maintenance reasons.

## Accounts and Access

**Do I need an account to use The Book Project?**  
Yes. An account is required to create and manage your library.

**How do I create an account?**  
You can register through the website. You’ll need to verify your email address before your account is fully active.

**Can I sign in with Google instead of a password?**  
Google sign-in exists in the system but is currently disabled. For now, use email and password.

**What if I forget my password?**  
You can request a password reset email from the login page. For security reasons, password reset requests are limited.

**Can I change my email address later?**  
Yes. Changing your email address requires verification to make sure it really belongs to you.

**Can I disable or delete my account?**  
Yes. You can disable your account or request deletion. Account deletion requires confirmation and may involve manual follow-up to avoid accidental data loss.

**Can more than one person use the app?**  
Yes. Each user has their own separate account and private library.

## Your Library

**What can I store in my library?**  
You can store books, authors, publishers, series, tags, languages, storage locations, and individual copies of books.

**Can I track more than one copy of the same book?**  
Yes. You can record multiple copies of the same book and track where each one is stored.

**How are authors and series handled?**  
Authors, publishers, and series are managed separately and can be reused across multiple books. This helps keep your library consistent and organised.

**Can I store incomplete information?**  
Yes. If you don’t know an exact date or detail (for example, an author’s full birth date), you can store partial information.

**Can I add notes or personal details?**  
Yes. You can add notes, descriptions, and acquisition stories to books and copies.

**Can I add cover images?**  
Yes, by linking to an image URL. The app does not upload or store image files directly.

**Can I import or export my data?**  
Import and export are available but currently limited. They should not be relied on as a primary backup or migration method.

**If I delete something, is it gone forever?**  
Not always. Many items go to your recycle bin and can be restored. You can permanently delete items from the recycle bin. Not all items use soft deletion, so read the confirmation message before deleting.

## API and Advanced Use

**Is there an API?**  
Yes. The same API that powers the website is also available for personal scripts or integrations.

**Do I need programming knowledge to use the app?**  
No. The website is designed to work on its own. The API is optional and intended for advanced users.

**Are there limits on usage?**  
Some actions (like login attempts or password resets) are limited to protect against abuse.

---

## Admin Access

**Who are admins?**  
Admins are trusted operators who maintain and support the system.

**Can admins see my library?**  
Admins can view library data when needed for troubleshooting, maintenance, or support.

**Can admins change or remove my data?**  
Admins may modify or remove data if required for operational or safety reasons, but this is not done casually.

---

## Data, Storage, and Security

**Where is my data stored?**  
Your data is stored on a privately managed server in South Africa.

**Is my data secure?**  
Passwords are securely hashed, and backups are encrypted. While care is taken to protect your data, no system can guarantee absolute security.

**Are backups made?**  
Yes. Encrypted backups are created daily.

**How long are backups kept?**  
Backups are kept for up to 28 days before being rotated.

**What happens if something goes wrong and data is lost?**  
Backups reduce the risk of loss, but they are not a guarantee. You are encouraged to export your data periodically for your own records.

## Availability and Reliability

**Is the service always online?**  
No. The Book Project does not have an uptime guarantee.

**Can the site go offline?**  
Yes. Maintenance, updates, or technical issues may cause temporary downtime.

**Will I be warned about maintenance?**  
Where possible, maintenance notices may be shown, but this is not guaranteed.

---

## Privacy and Legal

**Do you sell or share my data?**  
No. Your data is not sold. It is shared only with essential service providers as described in the Privacy Policy.

**Where can I read more about data handling?**  
The Privacy Policy explains in detail what data is collected and how it is used.

**Do you track me or show ads?**  
No advertising or tracking systems are built into the app at this time.

---

## Limitations

**Does the app work offline?**  
No. An internet connection is required.

**Is there a mobile app?**  
No. The app works in a web browser. Mobile usability depends on your device and browser.

**Can I manage multiple libraries in one account?**  
No. Each account represents a single library.

## Future Development

**Is The Book Project still being worked on?**  
Yes. Features may be improved, changed, or added over time.

**Will features ever be removed?**  
Possibly. There is no guarantee that all features will remain unchanged forever.

**Can I suggest features?**  
You can contact support with suggestions, but there is no promise that requests will be implemented.
