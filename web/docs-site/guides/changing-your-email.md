# Change the Email Address associated with Your Account

Changing the email address associated with your Book Project account is a supported feature that allows you to update your contact information while ensuring the security and integrity of your account.

## Why would I want to change my email address?

You may want to change your email address for several reasons, including:
- You prefer to use a different email address for your Book Project account.
- You want to consolidate your online accounts under a single email address.
- You have changed your primary email address and want to keep your Book Project account up to date.
- You used the wrong email address when creating your account and need to correct it.

## Requesting an Email Address Change

To change your email address, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your Book Project account on the [login page](https://bookproject.fjnel.co.za/).
2. Once you're on your [dashboard](https://bookproject.fjnel.co.za/dashboard), click on the "Account" button in the navigation menu.
3. On the Account page, navigate to the "Security" tab.
4. In the "Email" section, click on the "Request email change" button to open the email change form.
5. Enter your new email address in the "New email address" field and click the "Send request" button.
6. After a few moments, a message will appear informing you that if the new email address is not already associated with another account, a verification email has been sent to the new email address.

The verification email contains a link that you will need to click to confirm the email address change. This link is valid for a limited time, so be sure to check your email and complete the verification process promptly. You must use the link in the email to verify your new email address; you cannot go to verification pages directly on the website without it.

> To prevent malicious actors from hijacking accounts, the system does not indicate whether the new email address is valid or not when requesting an email change: You will simply not receive a verification email if the address is already registered to another account. In this case, you may want to try again with a different email address that is not already in use.

> To enhance security and prevent abuse, email change requests are limited. If you exceed the allowed number of requests in a given time period, you may need to wait before trying again.

## Changing Your Email Address

To confirm your email address change using the link sent to your email, follow these steps:

1. Open your email inbox and look for an email from The Book Project.
2. Open the email and click on the blue "Confirm Email Change" button. This will take you back to The Book Project website and confirm your new email address.
3. On this page, you will need to enter your current email address, your new email address, and your account password.
4. Click the "Confirm Email Change" button to complete the email address change process. 
5. After a few moments, you should see a confirmation message indicating that your email address has been successfully changed. You will be logged out from all devices and sessions, and you can now log in using your new email address.

When you change your email address, you will be logged out of all devices and sessions. You will need to log in again with your new email address on all devices. If you used Sign in with Google, you may need to re-link your Google account (associated with your new email address) to your Book Project account after changing your email address.

For security reasons, changing your email address will send a notification email to both your old and new email addresses.

You will be taken to another form where you can enter your new email address again to request a new verification email. Be sure to complete the verification process promptly once you receive the new email, as the new link will also have a limited validity period.

In that case, if you made a mistake and want to revert to your previous email address, you will need to change your email address again by following the steps in this guide.

### Can someone else change my email address without my permission?

### I did not receive the email change request email after requesting one. What should I do?
When this happens, it could be due to several reasons:
- There may be a delay in email delivery. Wait a few minutes and check your inbox again.
- Double-check that you entered the correct new email address when requesting the email change.
- **The new email address you entered is already associated with an existing account:** In this case, you will not receive a new verification email.

### The new email address I want to use is already registered. What should I do?
If you have access to both email addresses and accounts, you have a few options:
1. **Option 1: Change the email address on the existing account:** Log in to the account associated with the new email address and change its email address to a different one using the steps outlined in this guide. Once that account's email address has been changed successfully, you can then proceed to change your original account's email address to the desired new email address.
2. **Option 2: Request account deletion:** If you no longer need the account associated with the new email address, you can use the [account deletion guide](/guides/deleting-your-account) to delete that account. After the account has been deleted, you can then proceed to change your original account's email address to the desired new email address.
3. **Option 3: Contact the System Administrator:** The System Administrator has the ability to assist with email address conflicts. You can contact them at [support@fjnel.co.za](mailto:support@fjnel.co.za?subject=Assistance%20with%20Book%20Project%20Email%20Address%20Conflict) for further assistance.

If you do not have access to the account associated with the new email address, you will not be able to change your email address to that one. You will need to choose a different email address that is not already in use. 

### Can I change my email address if I used Sign in with Google?
Yes, you can change your email address even if you used Sign in with Google to create your account. However, you will need to set a password for your Book Project account first, as changing your email address requires you to enter your account password. To set a password, follow the steps outlined in the [Resetting Your Password guide](/guides/reset-your-password). Once you have set a password, you can proceed to change your email address by following the steps in this guide. After changing your email address, you will need to re-link your Google account (associated with your new email address) to your Book Project account if you wish to use Sign in with Google in the future. Linking happens automatically when you Sign in with Google using the new email address for the first time after the change. *Sign in with Google is currently disabled*

### I changed my email address, but did not receive the notification emails. What should I do?
The email change notification emails should be sent automatically to both your old and new email addresses after you successfully change your email address. If you did not receive the emails, it is not a cause for immediate concern, but you may want to check your spam or junk folder to ensure they were not filtered there. If you continue to experience issues with receiving notification emails, please contact the System Administrator at [support@fjnel.co.za](mailto:support@fjnel.co.za?subject=Did%20not%20receive%20email%20change%20notification%20emails) for further assistance.

### I mistyped my new email address when requesting the change. What should I do?

To correct this, simply go back to your Account page, navigate to the "Security" tab, and follow the steps outlined in the "Requesting an Email Address Change" section of this guide to request a new email change with the correct email address. Be sure to complete the verification process promptly once you receive the new email, as the new link will also have a limited validity period.

### I no longer have access to my old email address. Can I still change my email address?
Yes, you can still change your email address even if you no longer have access to your old email address. The email change process requires you to have access to the new email address to confirm the change, but you do not need access to the old email address. Simply follow the steps outlined in the "Requesting an Email Address Change" section of this guide to request a new email change with your new email address.
