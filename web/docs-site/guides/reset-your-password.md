# Reset your Book Project Password

If you have forgotten your password or need to reset it for any reason, you can follow these steps to regain access to your account. 

If you signed up using Sign in with Google and you have not set a password for your Book Project account, you can also use this process to create a password for your account. This will enable you to log in using your email address and password in the future, while still allowing you to use Sign in with Google if you prefer. *Sign in with Google is currently disabled, so you will need to set a password to access your account.*

## When to Reset Your Password

Without your password, you cannot log in to your Book Project account. This means that you will not be able to access your library or any of the features of the application.

You may need to reset your password if:
- You have forgotten your password.
- You suspect that your password has been compromised.
- You want to create a password for your account after signing up with Sign in with Google.
- You want to change your password for security reasons, without being logged in.

If you are able to log in to your account and simply want to change your password, you can do so from your account settings without needing to go through the reset process. You can find instructions for changing your password in the [Changing Your Password guide](/guides/changing-your-password).

## Request a Password Reset

To request a password reset, follow these steps:

1. Open your web browser and go to the [Book Project login page](https://bookproject.fjnel.co.za/).
2. Click on the "Login" button to open the login form.
3. Below the login form, click on the "Forgot Password?" link. This will take you to the password reset request form.
4. Enter the email address associated with your Book Project account in the provided field.
5. Click the "Request Password Reset" button to submit your request.
6. After a few moments, a message will appear informing you that if an account with that email address exists, a password reset email has been sent. 

The password reset email contains a link that you will need to click to reset your password. This link is valid for a limited time, so be sure to check your email and complete the reset process promptly. You must use the link in the email to reset your password; you cannot go to reset your password page directly on the website without it.

> To prevent malicious actors from identifying which email addresses are registered, the system does not indicate whether an email address is valid or not when requesting a password reset: You will simply not receive an email if the address is not registered. In this case, you may want to try again with a different email address that you may have used to register your account, or consider creating a new account if you are unsure. 

> To enhance security and prevent abuse, password reset requests are limited. If you exceed the allowed number of requests in a given time period, you may need to wait before trying again.

## Reset Your Password

To reset your password using the link sent to your email, follow these steps:

1. Open your email inbox and look for an email from The Book Project with the subject "Reset your password for the Book Project".
2. Open the email and click on the red "Reset Password" button. This will take you to the password reset page on The Book Project website.
3. On the password reset page, enter your email address again in the provided field.
4. Enter your new password in the "Password" field. Make sure to choose a strong and secure password.
5. Click the "Reset Password" button to submit your new password.

## Questions

### I forgot my password. What should I do?
If you forgot your password, you can reset it by following the instructions in this guide.

### I didn't receive the password reset email. What should I do?
If you did not receive the password reset email, please check your spam or junk folder. If you still cannot find it, you can request a new password reset email by going to the [login page](https://bookproject.fjnel.co.za/), clicking on the "Login" button and then clicking the "Forgot Password?" link below the login form. You will be taken to another form where you can enter your email address again to request a new password reset email. For security reasons, password reset requests are limited: Try to be patient and wait a few minutes before requesting another email. 

### What happens if I click an expired password reset link?
If you click an expired password reset link, you will still be able to enter your email address and a new password to reset your password, but your reset will not be successful. You will need to request a new password reset email by following the steps outlined below.

### The password reset link has expired. What should I do?
If the password reset link has expired, you can request a new password reset email by following the same steps as above: go to the [login page](https://bookproject.fjnel.co.za/), click on the "Login" button and then click the "Forgot Password?" link below the login form. You will be taken to another form where you can enter your email address again to request a new password reset email. Be sure to complete the reset process promptly once you receive the new email, as the new link will also have a limited validity period. It is recommended to complete the password reset process as soon as possible, since you can only make a limited number of password reset requests in a given time period. After exceeding this limit, you may need to wait before being able to request another password reset email.

### I did not receive the password reset email after requesting a new one. What should I do?
When this happens, it could be due to several reasons:
- There may be a delay in email delivery. Wait a few minutes and check your inbox again.
- Double-check that you entered the correct email address when requesting the password reset email.
- **The email address you entered is not associated with any account:** In this case, you will not receive a password reset email. Instead, try requesting a password reset using a different email address that you may have used to register your account. If you are unsure, you may consider creating a new account.
- Your Book Project account may have been disabled (or deleted). This will prevent you from receiving password reset emails. If you believe this is the case, please contact the System Administrator at [support@fjnel.co.za](mailto:support@fjnel.co.za?subject=Assistance%20with%20Book%20Project%20Account%20Access). 

## I reset my password, but I still can't log in. What should I do?
If you reset your password but are still unable to log in, please ensure that you are entering the correct email address and the new password you just set. Passwords are case-sensitive, so make sure that your Caps Lock key is not enabled and that you are typing the password exactly as you set it. If you continue to experience issues, you can try resetting your password again by following the steps in this guide. If you are still unable to log in after multiple attempts, please contact the System Administrator at [support@fjnel.co.za](mailto:support@fjnel.co.za?subject=Assistance%20with%20Book%20Project%20Account%20Access).

### Can I use Google sign-in to reset my password?
No, Sign in with Google is a separate authentication method and does not involve passwords. If you signed up using Sign in with Google and have not set a password for your Book Project account, you can use the password reset process described in this guide to create a password for your account. This will enable you to log in using your email address and password in the future, while still allowing you to use Sign in with Google if you prefer. *Sign in with Google is currently disabled, so you will need to set a password to access your account.*

### Can I reuse an old password when resetting my password?
Yes, you can reuse an old password when resetting your password. However, for security reasons, it is recommended to choose a strong and unique password that you have not used before. This helps protect your account from unauthorized access. 

### Can someone else reset my password?
No, only the person who has access to the email address associated with the Book Project account can reset the password. The password reset process requires clicking a link sent to that email address, so if you do not have access to the email account, you will not be able to reset the password. If you believe someone else is trying to reset your password without your permission, please contact the System Administrator at [support@fjnel.co.za](mailto:support@fjnel.co.za?subject=Unauthorized%20Password%20Reset%20Attempt).

> If your email address is compromised, an attacker could potentially request a password reset and gain access to your Book Project account. To protect your account, ensure that your email account is secure. If you suspect that your email account has been compromised, you can disable your Book Project account (see the [Disabling Your Account guide](/guides/disabling-your-account)) to prevent unauthorized access until you can regain control of your email. 

### I received a password reset email, but I didn't request it. What should I do?
If you received a password reset email that you did not request, it is possible that someone else mistakenly entered your email address when trying to reset their own password. In this case, you can simply ignore the email, and no changes will be made to your account. However, if you are concerned that someone may be attempting to gain unauthorized access to your account, it is recommended to change your password as a precautionary measure. You can do this by following the steps in this guide to request a password reset and set a new password for your account. If you are really concerned about the security of your account, you can disable your account temporarily by following the steps in the [Disabling Your Account guide](/guides/disabling-your-account) until you can ensure that your account is secure. If you continue to receive unsolicited password reset emails, please contact the System Administrator at [support@fjnel.co.za](mailto:support@fjnel.co.za?subject=Unsolicited%20Password%20Reset%20Emails).

### I no longer have access to the email address associated with my account. What should I do?
If you no longer have access to the email address associated with your Book Project account, you will not be able to receive the password reset email. In this case, please contact the System Administrator at [support@fjnel.co.za](mailto:support@fjnel.co.za?subject=Assistance%20with%20Book%20Project%20Account%20Access). 

### I forgot which email address I used to register my account. What should I do?
If you forgot which email address you used to register your Book Project account, you should contact the System Administrator at [support@fjnel.co.za](mailto:support@fjnel.co.za?subject=Assistance%20with%20Book%20Project%20Account%20Access). They may be able to help you recover your account by verifying your identity through other means.

### Can I request multiple password reset emails?
Yes, you can request multiple password reset emails if needed. However, for security reasons, password reset requests are limited. If you exceed the allowed number of requests in a given time period, you may need to wait before trying again. It is recommended to be patient and wait a few minutes before requesting another password reset email.

### How can I create a strong password?
By default, The Book Project enforces the following password requirements:
- A minimum length of 10 characters and a maximum length of 100 characters.
- At least one uppercase letter (A-Z).
- At least one lowercase letter (a-z).
- At least one number (0-9).
- At least one special character (e.g. !@#$%^&*).

This however is not an exhaustive list of best practices for creating strong passwords. Here are some additional tips:
- Avoid using common words, phrases, or easily guessable information (like "password", "123456", or your name).
- Use a mix of different character types (letters, numbers, special characters).
- Consider using a passphrase made up of multiple random words.
- Use a password manager to generate and store complex passwords securely.
- Change your passwords regularly and avoid reusing passwords across different accounts.
- Do not share your passwords with anyone.
