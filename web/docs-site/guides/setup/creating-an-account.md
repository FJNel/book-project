# Creating a Book Project Account

To get started with The Book Project, you'll need to create an account. Creating an account allows you to securely manage your personal book collection in The Book Project. Once registered, you can log in and start adding books, authors, publishers, and other related information to your library.

## When to Create an Account

The Book Project has very limited functionality available without an account. To fully utilise the features of The Book Project, including adding and managing your library data, you will need to create an account.

You should create an account if you want to:
- Store and manage your personal library data, including books, authors, publishers, series, tags, and storage locations.
- Access your library data from any device with internet access.
- Keep your library data private and secure.

Without an account, you will not be able to view or save any library data. You will only have access to the registration and login pages, and limited informational content like the documentation site.

## What You Need to Create an Account

To create an account on The Book Project, you will need the following:
- A valid email address: This will be used for account verification, password resets, and important notifications.
- A secure password: Choose a strong password to protect your account. The password should be at least 8 characters long and include a mix of letters, numbers, and special characters.

## Steps to Create an Account

To create an account on The Book Project, follow these steps:

1. Open your web browser and go to [bookproject.fjnel.co.za](https://bookproject.fjnel.co.za). 
2. Click on the Register button on the homepage. A registration form will appear.
3. Fill in the registration form with the following details:
   - Full Name: Enter your full name.
   - Preferred Name: Enter the name you would like to be addressed by (optional). This is used for personalising communications.
   - Email Address: Enter a valid email address. You will need to verify this email to activate your account, so make sure it is correct and belongs to you.
   - Password: Create a secure password. The password should be at least 8 characters long and include a mix of letters, numbers, and special characters.
4. Click the Register button to submit your registration. After a few seconds, a message will appear informing you that a verification email has been sent to the email address you provided, as long as your email is not already associated with an existing account.

The verification email contains a link that you will need to click to verify your email address and activate your account. This link is valid for a limited time, so be sure to check your email and complete the verification process promptly. You must use the link in the email to verify your email address; you cannot go to verification pages directly on the website without it.

## Verify Your Email Address

To ensure that your email address is valid and belongs to you, you will need to verify it:

1. Open your email inbox and look for an email from The Book Project with the subject Verify your email address for the Book Project.
2. Open the email and click on the blue Verify Email button. This will take you back to The Book Project website and confirm your email address.
3. On this page, you will need to enter your email address again to complete the verification process. After clicking Verify Email, you should see a confirmation message indicating that your email has been successfully verified. You should be redirected to a page with the login form already visible.

If you do not verify your email address, you will not be able to log in to your account or use The Book Project's features. 
   
## Logging In For the First Time

Once your email is verified, you can log in to your new account:

1. On the login page, enter your registered email address and password.
2. Click the Log In button to access your account. If your credentials are correct, you will be logged in and redirected to your dashboard, where you can start adding books and managing your library.

## Passwords and Security

Your password is stored securely and cannot be viewed by anyone, including The Book Project administrators. 

To keep your Book Project account safe and secure, and to prevent unauthorized access, follow these best practices:
- Use a strong, unique password that is not used for any other online accounts.
- Do not share your password with anyone.
- Log out of your account when using shared or public computers.

## Questions

### I didn't receive the verification email. What should I do?
If you did not receive the verification email, please check your spam or junk folder. If you still cannot find it, you can request a new verification email by going to the [login page](https://bookproject.fjnel.co.za/), clicking on the Login button, typing in your email address and a random password, clicking Log In, and then clicking the Resend Verification Email link in the yellow alert box. You will be taken to another form where you can enter your email address again to request a new verification email. 

### What happens if I click an expired verification link?
If you click an expired verification link, you will still be able to enter your email address to verify your email, but your verification will not be successful. You will need to request a new verification email by following the steps outlined below.

### The verification link has expired. What should I do?
If the verification link has expired, you can request a new verification email by following the same steps as above: go to the [login page](https://bookproject.fjnel.co.za/), click on the Login button, type in your email address and a random password, click Log In, and then click the Resend Verification Email link in the yellow alert box. You will be taken to another form where you can enter your email address again to request a new verification email. Be sure to complete the verification process promptly once you receive the new email, as the new link will also have a limited validity period.

### I did not receive the verification email after requesting a new one. What should I do?
When this happens, it could be due to several reasons:
- There may be a delay in email delivery. Wait a few minutes and check your inbox again.
- Double-check that you entered the correct email address when requesting the verification email.
- **The email address you entered is already associated with an existing account:** In this case, you will not receive a new verification email. Instead, try logging in with your existing account credentials. If you have forgotten your password, you can [reset your password](/guides/setup/reset-your-password).
  
> To prevent malicious actors from identifying which email addresses are registered, the system does not indicate whether an email address is already in use when requesting a new verification email: You will simply not receive a new email if the address is already registered.

### I think my email address is already registered. What should I do?
If you believe your email address is already registered, try logging in with your existing account credentials. If you have forgotten your password, you can [reset your password](/guides/setup/reset-your-password). If you are still having trouble accessing your account, please contact the System Administrator at [support@fjnel.co.za](mailto:support@fjnel.co.za?subject=Assistance%20with%20Book%20Project%20Account%20Access) for further assistance.

### I entered the wrong email address during registration. How can I fix this?
If you entered the wrong email address during registration, you will need to create a new account using the correct email address: Follow the steps outlined in this guide to register again with the correct email. To keep The Book Project accessible and easy to use, please contact the System Administrator at [support@fjnel.co.za](mailto:support@fjnel.co.za?subject=Delete%20Unverified%20Account) with the incorrect email address and request deletion of the unverified account.

### Can I use Google sign-in to create an account?
No, Google sign-in is currently disabled in The Book Project. You will need to create an account using your email address and a password as described in this guide. Sign in with Google may be re-enabled in the future, but for now, please use the email/password method to create and access your account.

### Can I change my email address after creating an account?
Yes, you can change your email address after creating an account. Find a detailed guide on [changing your email address here](/guides/account/changing-your-email).

### What if I forget my password?
If you forget your password, you can reset it by following the instructions in the [password reset guide](/guides/setup/reset-your-password).
