## What each Email Category Means

### Essential account emails (Required)
These emails are necessary for the operation of your account, such as password resets and security notifications. You cannot opt out of these emails as they are crucial for account security and management. 

For example, you will receive emails for:
- Email verification requests
- Password reset requests
- Email change requests and confirmations

### Account updates
These emails include notifications about changes to your account, such as profile updates, changes made by administrators, or important announcements related to your account.

### Development and features
These emails provide information about new features, updates, and improvements to The Book Project. They may also include announcements about maintenance, bug fixes, and other development-related news.
> Development and features emails are **opt-in**, and you can choose to receive them if you are interested in staying informed about the latest developments. You will not receive these emails unless you explicitly opt in.

## Questions

### Which emails are required and why?
The "Essential account emails" category is required because it includes critical communications necessary for the security and management of your account. These emails ensure that you can reset your password, verify your email address, and receive important notifications about your account's security. Opting out of these emails could lead to issues with account access and security, which is why they are mandatory.

### Can I opt out of all emails from The Book Project?
No, you cannot opt out of all emails from The Book Project. The "Essential account emails" category is required and cannot be unsubscribed from. However, you can choose to opt out of the "Account updates" and "Development and features" categories if you do not wish to receive those types of communications.

### Can I opt out of account updates emails?
Yes, you can opt out of the "Account updates" emails by unchecking the box next to that category in your email preferences. This will stop you from receiving notifications about changes to your account, such as profile updates or important announcements related to your account. However, you will still receive essential account emails that are necessary for account security and management.

### Can I opt out of development and features emails?
Yes, you can opt out of the "Development and features" emails by unchecking the box next to that category in your email preferences. This will stop you from receiving updates about new features, improvements, and development news from The Book Project.

### Will I still receive essential account emails if I opt out of the other categories? 
Yes, you will still receive essential account emails even if you opt out of the "Account updates" and "Development and features" categories. The essential account emails are required and cannot be unsubscribed from, so you will continue to receive important communications related to your account's security and management regardless of your preferences for the other categories.

### Can I change my email preferences at any time?
Yes, you can change your email preferences at any time by following the steps outlined above. Simply log in to your account, navigate to the "Email Preferences" tab, and update your selections as needed. Your new preferences will be saved and applied to future communications from The Book Project.

### Will my email preferences be remembered next time I log in?
Yes, The Book Project saves your email preferences to your account settings, so your chosen preferences will be applied automatically the next time you log in. This means that you won't have to reconfigure your email preferences each time you access your account.

### Can I receive different email preferences on different devices?
No, your email preferences are saved to your account settings and will be consistent across all devices when you log in. This means that the same email preferences will apply regardless of which device you use to access The Book Project.

### Will changing my email preferences affect the functionality of The Book Project?
No, changing your email preferences only affects the types of emails you receive from The Book Project. It does not affect the functionality of the application or your ability to use its features. You will still have full access to all features and functionalities of The Book Project regardless of your email preferences.

### Can I customize the types of emails I receive beyond the provided categories?
Currently, The Book Project does not offer additional customization options beyond the provided email categories. However, future updates may include more granular control over email preferences.

### Why did I receive an email that I thought I had unsubscribed from?
If you received an email that you thought you had unsubscribed from, it could be due to a few reasons:
- The email may fall under the "Essential account emails" category, which is required and cannot be unsubscribed from.
- There may have been a delay in processing your email preference changes, and the email was sent before your preferences were updated.
- There could be a technical issue with the email preference system. If you continue to receive unwanted emails, please contact the system administrator at [support@fjnel.co.za](mailto:support@fjnel.co.za?subject=Email%20Preference%20Issue) for assistance.

### How long does it take for email preference changes to take effect?
Email preference changes typically take effect immediately after you save your new preferences. However, there may be a short delay in processing the changes, especially if there are emails already queued for sending. If you continue to receive emails that you have unsubscribed from after a reasonable amount of time, please contact the system administrator at [support@fjnel.co.za](mailto:support@fjnel.co.za?subject=Email%20Preference%20Issue) for assistance.

### Will I receive a confirmation email after changing my email preferences?
No, you will not receive a confirmation email after changing your email preferences. However, you will see a confirmation message on the screen indicating that your preferences have been saved successfully. If you have any concerns about whether your preferences were updated correctly, you can review your current email preferences in the "Email Preferences" tab of your account settings.

### Can I receive a summary of my current email preferences?
Currently, The Book Project does not offer a feature to receive a summary of your current email preferences via email. However, you can view and review your current email preferences at any time by navigating to the "Email Preferences" tab in your account settings. This will allow you to see which categories of emails you are currently subscribed to and make any necessary changes.

### Can I change my email preferences later?
Yes, you can change your email preferences at any time by following the steps outlined above. Simply log in to your account, navigate to the "Email Preferences" tab, and update your selections as needed. Your new preferences will be saved and applied to future communications from The Book Project.
