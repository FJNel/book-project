# Devices and Sessions

Devices and Sessions refer to each unique device or browser instance that you use to access your Book Project account. This includes computers, smartphones, tablets, and web browsers.

When you log in to your Book Project account from a new device or browser, a new session is created. Each session is associated with a specific device or browser and has its own unique identifier to keep you logged in.

## Why should I manage my devices and sessions?

Managing your devices and sessions is important for several reasons:
- **Security**: Regularly reviewing your active sessions helps you identify any unauthorized access to your account. If you notice a session from an unfamiliar device or location, you can log it out immediately to protect your account.
- **Convenience**: Keeping track of your active sessions allows you to manage where you are logged in. You can log out from devices you no longer use or from public/shared devices to ensure your account remains secure.
- **Account Control**: By managing your sessions, you can ensure that only trusted devices have access to your account, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

## How to Manage Your Devices and Sessions

To view and manage your devices and sessions, follow these steps:
1. Log in to your Book Project account on the [login page](https://bookproject.fjnel.co.za/).
2. Once you're on your [dashboard](https://bookproject.fjnel.co.za/dashboard), click on the "Account" button in the navigation menu.
3. On the Account page, navigate to the "Security" tab.
4. In the "Devices and Sessions" section, you will see a list of all active sessions associated with your account. Each session will display information such as the device type, browser, IP address, the Issued date and time, and the expiration date and time.

The "Issued" date and time indicate when the session was created (when you logged in on that device or browser). The "Expires" date and time indicate when the session will automatically expire. Once a session expires, you will need to log in again on that device or browser to create a new session.

> Sessions expire 7 days after the session was issued. If you log out manually from a device or browser, the session will end immediately. You cannot extend the expiration time of an active session; you will need to log in again to create a new session.

## Logging Out of your Current Session

To log out of your current session, follow these steps:
1. Click on the "Log Out" button in the navigation menu at the top right corner of the page.
2. Click on the "This device only" button in the confirmation dialog that appears.
3. You will be logged out from your current device or browser and will be redirected to the login page.

## Logging Out of Another Session

## Questions

### What is considered a device or session?
A device or session refers to each unique device or browser instance that you use to access your Book Project account. This includes computers, smartphones, tablets, and web browsers. Each time you log in from a new device or browser, a new session is created. This means a session is tied to a specific device or browser and has its own unique identifier to keep you logged in. 

### Why are there multiple sessions listed for the same device or browser?
Multiple sessions may be listed for the same device or browser if you have logged in multiple times from that device or browser. Each time you log in, a new session is created, even if it's from the same device or browser. This can happen if you clear your browser cookies and log in again. Each session will have its own unique identifier and expiration time. 

### Does opening a new tab or window create a new session?
No, opening a new tab or window in the same browser does not create a new session. Sessions are tied to the browser instance, so as long as you are using the same browser on the same device, you will remain in the same session. However, if you log out and log back in, or if you use a different browser or device, a new session will be created.

### Why does my phone and laptop show different sessions?
Each device, such as your phone and laptop, is considered a separate device or session. When you log in from your phone, a session is created for that specific device. Similarly, when you log in from your laptop, another session is created for that device. Each session is unique to the device and browser you are using, which is why they appear as separate sessions in the "Devices and Sessions" section.

### What does the "Issued" date and time mean?
The "Issued" date and time indicate when the session was created, which is when you logged in on that specific device or browser. This timestamp helps you identify when each session started, allowing you to track your login activity across different devices and browsers.

### What does the "Expires" date and time mean?
The "Expires" date and time indicate when the session will automatically expire. Sessions are set to expire 7 days after they are issued. Once a session expires, you will need to log in again on that device or browser to create a new session. This expiration mechanism helps enhance the security of your account by ensuring that you are periodically required to re-authenticate using your credentials.

### Why do sessions expire after 7 days?
Sessions expire after 7 days as a security measure to help protect your account from unauthorized access. By requiring periodic re-authentication, it reduces the risk of someone gaining prolonged access to your account if they were to obtain your login credentials. This expiration policy encourages users to regularly verify their identity, ensuring that only authorized users can maintain access to their accounts over time.

### Can I extend the expiration time of a session?
No, you cannot extend the expiration time of an active session. Once a session is created, it is set to expire 7 days after the "Issued" date and time. If you want to continue using your account on that device or browser after the session expires, you will need to log in again to create a new session. This helps maintain the security of your account by ensuring that users periodically re-authenticate.

### What happens when a session expires?
When a session expires, you will not be able to access your Book Project account from that device or browser without logging in again. You will be redirected to the login page, where you will need to enter your email address and password to create a new session. This process ensures that only authorized users can access the account after the session has expired, enhancing the overall security of your account. 

### What happens when I log out manually from a device or browser?
When you log out manually from a device or browser, the session associated with that device or browser is terminated immediately. You will be logged out of your Book Project account on that specific device or browser, and you will need to log in again to create a new session if you wish to access your account from that device or browser in the future. Manual logout helps ensure that your account remains secure, especially when using public or shared devices.

### Can someone stay logged in after I change my password?
No, when you change your password, all active sessions associated with your account are invalidated. This means that anyone who is currently logged in on any device or browser will be logged out and will need to log in again using the new password. This security measure helps protect your account by ensuring that only users with the updated credentials can maintain access after a password change.

### Can someone stay logged in after I change my email address?
No, when you change your email address, all active sessions associated with your account are invalidated. This means that anyone who is currently logged in on any device or browser will be logged out and will need to log in again using the updated email address. This security measure helps protect your account by ensuring that only users with the correct credentials can maintain access after an email address change.

### Is it safe to leave sessions active on my own devices?
Yes, it is generally safe to leave sessions active on your own trusted devices, such as your personal computer, smartphone, or tablet. However, it is important to ensure that these devices are secure and not accessible to unauthorized users.

### Are sessions encrypted and protected?
Yes, sessions in The Book Project are encrypted and protected using standard security practices. We use a two-layer approach to secure sessions:
1. **15-minute short-lived access tokens**: These tokens are used for contacting our services and expire after 15 minutes. This limits the time window in which a token can be used if it were to be intercepted by a malicious actor.
2. **7-day refresh tokens**: These tokens are used to obtain new access tokens and expire after 7 days. This means that even if an attacker were to obtain a refresh token, they would only have a limited time to use it before it becomes invalid.

### What's the difference between logging out of a single session and logging out of all sessions?
Logging out of a single session terminates the session associated with a specific device or browser, while logging out of all sessions terminates all active sessions across all devices and browsers. This means that when you log out of a single session, you will only be logged out from that specific device or browser, whereas logging out of all sessions will log you out from every device and browser where you are currently logged in.

### Will logging out of another session affect my current session?
No, logging out of another session will not affect your current session. When you log out of a specific session, only that session is terminated, and you will remain logged in on your current device or browser. This allows you to manage your sessions without disrupting your current access to your Book Project account.

### Does logging out immediately end access to my account on that device or browser?
Yes, logging out of a session immediately ends access to your Book Project account on that specific device or browser. Once you confirm the logout action, the session is terminated, and you will no longer be able to access your account from that device or browser until you log in again. This immediate termination helps ensure the security of your account, especially when logging out from public or shared devices.

### Can I log out of a session, even if it's currently active on another device?
Yes, you can log out of sessions that are currently active on other devices or browsers. In the "Devices and Sessions" section of your Account page, you will see a list of all active sessions associated with your account. You can select any session from that list and click the "Log Out" button next to it to terminate that specific session, regardless of whether it is currently active on another device or browser. Access to your account from that device or browser will end immediately upon logging out.

### When should I log out of all sessions?
You should consider logging out of all sessions if you suspect that your account has been compromised or accessed by an unauthorized person. You can also log out of all sessions if you have used a public or shared device to access your account, or if you simply want to ensure that no other devices or browsers have access to your account. Logging out of all sessions helps enhance the security of your account by terminating access from all devices and browsers, requiring re-authentication for future access. 

You are automatically logged out of all sessions when you change your password or your email address. Changing your password is another good way to ensure that all sessions are logged out and that only users with the updated credentials can maintain access to your account.

### I accidentally logged out of all sessions. Can I revert this?
No, once you log out of all sessions, the action cannot be reverted. You will need to log in again on each device or browser where you want to access your Book Project account. This is a security measure to ensure that only authorized users can regain access to the account after logging out of all sessions.

### Why does my browser name or device type look different than expected?
The browser name or device type displayed in the "Devices and Sessions" section is determined by the user-agent string sent by your browser when you access the Book Project. Sometimes, browsers may use generic or less common identifiers that do not match the expected names. Additionally, certain privacy settings or extensions may modify the user-agent string, leading to unexpected names being displayed. If you notice discrepancies, it is likely due to how your browser identifies itself to websites. 

### I logged out of a session, but it still appears in the list. Why?
Sometimes our server may not accept the logout request. In this case, a message will be shown indicating that the logout failed. If you see this message, please try logging out of the session again. If the logout request was successful but the session still appears in the list, it may take a few moments for the list to update. You can refresh the page to see the most current list of active sessions. If the session still appears after refreshing, please contact the System Administrator at [support@fjnel.co.za](mailto:support@fjnel.co.za?subject=%20Session%20Logout%20Issue) for further assistance.

### A session disappeared from the list without me logging out. Why?
Sessions can disappear from the list for a few reasons:
- **Expiration**: Sessions are set to expire 7 days after they are issued. If a session reaches its expiration time, it will be automatically removed from the list.
- **Manual Logout**: If you or someone with access to your account manually logged out of a session, it will be removed from the list.
- **Account Changes**: If you changed your password or email address, all active sessions would be invalidated and removed from the list.
- **System Maintenance**: Occasionally, system maintenance or updates may result in sessions being cleared or removed.
