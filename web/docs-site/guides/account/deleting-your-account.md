# Delete Your Account

If you wish to permanently delete your Book Project account and all associated data, please follow the steps outlined in this guide. Account deletion is irreversible and will result in the loss of all your library data, including books, authors, publishers, and other related information.

Account deletion is a multi-step process to ensure that it is intentional and secure. Please read through the entire guide before proceeding. 

To temporarily disable your account instead of deleting it, please refer to the [Disabling Your Account guide](/guides/account/disabling-your-account).

Please ensure that you have backed up any important data before proceeding with account deletion, since this action cannot be undone.

### Why is account deletion a multi-step process?

This added layer of security protects your data and helps maintain the integrity of The Book Project system.

### Why do I need to type `DELETE` to confirm my account deletion request?
Typing `DELETE` in uppercase serves as an additional confirmation step to ensure that you fully understand the consequences of account deletion. This requirement helps prevent accidental deletions by making you consciously acknowledge that you are requesting a permanent and irreversible action. It acts as a safeguard to ensure that account deletion is intentional and that you have carefully considered the implications before proceeding.

It also provides an opportunity for you to reconsider the deletion before it is finalized. By using email confirmation, we can better protect your data and maintain the integrity of The Book Project system.

This helps protect your data and maintain the integrity of The Book Project system by ensuring that only valid deletion requests are processed.

This will enable you to log in using your email address and password in the future, while still allowing you to use Sign in with Google if you prefer. *Sign in with Google is currently disabled, so you will need to set a password to access your account and proceed with account deletion.* Once you have set a password, you can follow the steps in this guide to request account deletion.

### I changed my mind. Can I cancel my account deletion request?
This depends on the stage of the deletion process.

However, if you have already confirmed your deletion request via email and your request is under review by the system administrator, you will need to contact the System Administrator at [support@fjnel.co.za](mailto:support@fjnel.co.za?subject=Cancel%20Account%20Deletion%20Request) to inquire about the possibility of canceling the deletion. Please note that once your account has been permanently deleted, it cannot be recovered.

When creating a new account, you will need to use a different email address than the one associated with your deleted account, as email addresses are unique identifiers in The Book Project system. If you wish to use the same email address, you will need to wait until the deletion process is fully completed and the email address is released from the deleted account.
