# Disable Your Account

If you wish to disable your account on The Book Project, you can do so through your account settings. Disabling your account will make your library and personal data inaccessible, but it will not delete your data permanently.

Disabling your account is a reversible action. If you decide to return to The Book Project in the future, you can reactivate your account by contacting the System Administrator at [support@fjnel.co.za](mailto:support@fjnel.co.za?subject=Account%20Reactivation%20Request). Please note that reactivation may require verification of your identity to ensure the security of your data.

When you disable your account, the following will occur:
- You will no longer be able to log in or access your library.
- Your personal data and library information will be retained in the system but will be inaccessible.
- You will not receive any further communications from The Book Project unless you choose to reactivate your account.
- You will be able to re-enable your account and continue using The Book Project as before.

To permanently delete your account and all associated data, please refer to the [deleting your account guide](/guides/account/deleting-your-account).

## Why Disable Your Account?
You might choose to disable your account for various reasons, such as taking a break from The Book Project, concerns about account security, or other personal reasons. Disabling your account allows you to retain your data without permanently deleting it.

## Questions

### What does it mean to disable my account?
Disabling your account makes your library and personal data inaccessible, but it does not delete your data permanently. You can reactivate your account later if you choose to do so. 

### Will my data be deleted when I disable my account?
No. Your data will be retained in the system but will be inaccessible until you choose to reactivate your account. This allows you to preserve your library and personal information without permanently deleting it.

### Can I still log in after disabling my account?
No. Once your account is disabled, you will not be able to log in or access your library until you reactivate your account by contacting the System Administrator. 

### What's the difference between disabling and deleting my account?
Disabling your account temporarily deactivates it, allowing you to reactivate it later with all your data intact. Deleting your account permanently removes all your data from The Book Project system and cannot be undone. 

### When should I disable my account instead of deleting it?
You should consider disabling your account if you want to take a break from The Book Project or have concerns about account security but wish to retain your data for future use. If you are certain that you no longer want to use The Book Project and want to permanently remove your data, then deleting your account is the appropriate action.

### Can a disabled account be deleted later?
Yes. If you decide to permanently delete your account after disabling it, you can contact the System Administrator to initiate the deletion process. Please note that account deletion is irreversible and will result in the permanent loss of all your data. 

### Is my account disabled immediately after I confirm the request?
Yes. Once you confirm the disable request via the email link and complete the confirmation process, your account will be disabled immediately. You will no longer be able to log in or access your library.

### I didn't receive the confirm account disable email. What should I do?
If you did not receive the confirmation email, please check your spam or junk folder to ensure it was not filtered there. If you still cannot find the email, you can try requesting the account disable process again from your account settings. If the issue persists, please contact the System Administrator at [support@fjnel.co.za](mailto:support@fjnel.co.za?subject=Account%20Disable%20Request).

### How long does it take to disable my account?
The account disabling process is typically immediate once you confirm the request via the email link. After completing the confirmation steps, your account will be disabled right away. 

### Can I reactivate my account on my own?
No. Reactivating a disabled account requires contacting the System Administrator. You will need to send an email to [support@fjnel.co.za](mailto:support@fjnel.co.za?subject=Account%20Reactivation%20Request). The System Administrator will manually re-enable your account, and you may be required to re-verify your email to ensure the security of your data.

### Will I lose my data if I disable my account?
No. Disabling your account does not delete your data. Your library and personal information will be retained in the system but will be inaccessible until you choose to reactivate your account. 

### Can I use the same email address to create a new account after disabling mine?
No. Since an account with your email address still exists in the system (albeit disabled), you will not be able to create a new account using the same email address. If you wish to create a new account, you will need to use a different email address, or re-activate your disabled account by contacting the System Administrator, or delete your disabled account permanently before creating a new one with the same email.

### Can I use Google sign-in to disable my account?
No, Sign in with Google is a separate authentication method and does not relate to disabling your account. Attempting to access a disabled account via Google sign-in will not work. You only require your email address to confirm the disable request via the email link sent to you. 

### Who can access my library when my account is disabled?
When your account is disabled, your library and personal data are inaccessible to you and others. However, system administrators may still have access for maintenance or support purposes, but they will not be able to use your account or access your library without reactivating it first. 

### I changed my mind, can I cancel the disable request?
This depends on whether you have already confirmed the disable request via the email link. If you have not yet confirmed the request, you can simply ignore the email, and your account will remain active. However, if you have already confirmed the disable request, you will need to contact the System Administrator to reactivate your account.

### Will I receive confirmation that my account has been disabled?
Yes. After you complete the confirmation process via the email link, you will see a message on the website confirming that your account has been successfully disabled. You will also receive an email notification confirming the action.

### Will I stop receiving emails from The Book Project after disabling my account?
Yes. Once your account is disabled, you will no longer receive any communications from The Book Project unless you choose to reactivate your account in the future.

### How can I contact support if my account is disabled?
If your account is disabled and you need assistance, you can contact the System Administrator by sending an email to [support@fjnel.co.za](mailto:support@fjnel.co.za?subject=Account%20Support%20Request).

### What information is required to reactivate my account?
To reactivate your account, you will need to contact the System Administrator at [support@fjnel.co.za](mailto:support@fjnel.co.za?subject=Account%20Reactivation%20Request). The System Administrator may require you to verify your identity to ensure the security of your data before re-enabling your account. You will also need to re-verify your email address as part of the reactivation process. To ensure a smooth reactivation, it is recommended to contact the System Administrator from the email address associated with your disabled account.

### Will my data be restored exactly as it was before disabling my account?
Yes. When you reactivate your account, all your data, including your library and personal information, will be restored exactly as it was before you disabled your account. You will need to log in again on all your devices to access your library.
