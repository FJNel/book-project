# Languages in Books

This guide explains how language assignment works on books, how language filtering works on Books, and how to request new language options.

## What Is a Language in The Book Project?

A language is a shared value attached to a book, such as English or Afrikaans.

Books can have one or more language values, and those values can be used in books filtering.

## Who Manages the Language List?

Languages are site-wide and managed by administrators.

Regular users can select existing languages on Add Book and Edit Book, but cannot create new language options themselves.

If you need a new language:

- Email [support@fjnel.co.za](mailto:support@fjnel.co.za?subject=Book%20Project%20%E2%80%94%20Request%20to%20add%20language%3A%20%3CLanguage%20Name%3E).
- Suggested subject: `Book Project — Request to add language: <Language Name>`.
- Include the language name, ISO code if known, and any spelling note.

## Where You Assign Languages

Language assignment is available on:

- Add Book > Step 2: Enter Book Details > Book Language(s).
- Edit Book > Step 1: Enter Book Details > Book Language(s).

There is no separate language quick-edit button on Book Details.

## Steps To Add or Remove Languages on a Book

1. Open Add Book or Edit Book.
2. In Book Language(s), choose a value from Select language....
3. Click Add.
4. Repeat for additional languages.
5. Remove a selected language with its remove button.
6. Save through the review and confirm steps.

## Language Field Behavior

- Selected languages are shown as removable pills.
- The same language cannot be selected twice.
- After you add a language, it is removed from the dropdown choices until removed from the selected list.
- If no selectable values remain, the dropdown and Add button are disabled.

## Why Duplicate Languages Are Blocked

Duplicate blocking keeps each language list clean and predictable.

Without duplicates, filters and displays stay accurate and easy to read.

## Why the Add Button Is Disabled

The Add button is disabled when there is nothing left to add from the dropdown.

Common cases:

- You already selected all currently available languages.
- No language options are currently available for your account.

What to do:

- If you selected all options, remove one language first, then add the new one you want.
- If you need a language that is missing entirely, send a request to support.

## Filters And Search (Books Language Filter)

Use Books > Advanced filters > Languages to find titles by language.

### Languages Selection

Meaning:

- Filters books by selected language values.

Blank behavior:

- No selected values means no language filter.

### OR and AND

Meaning:

- OR returns books with any selected language.
- AND returns books that contain all selected languages.

Examples:

- English + Afrikaans with OR returns books that have English or Afrikaans.
- English + Afrikaans with AND returns only books that have both.

### Combining With Other Filters

Language filtering combines with other filter groups using AND.

Example: Languages + Book Type + Published after means all selected conditions must match.

### Reset Behavior

- Reset filters and Clear all filters clear selected languages and reset the language match mode.
- Clear next to Search by Title only clears title search.

## Questions

### Can a Book Have More Than One Language?

Yes. A book can have multiple language values.

Add each one from the dropdown and click Add.

### Why Can’t I Add the Same Language Twice?

Duplicates are blocked on purpose.

This keeps each book’s language list clean and prevents confusing filter results.

### Why Is Add Disabled Even Though I Want Another Language?

Add is disabled when there are no remaining choices in the dropdown.

If the language you need is missing from the global list, request it through support.

### Can I Create a New Language From Add Book or Edit Book?

No. Those pages only let you choose existing values.

Language creation is handled by administrators.

### How Do I Ask for a New Language?

Use the support link in this guide with the prefilled subject.

Include language name, ISO code if known, and any spelling note to speed up review.

### How Does OR vs AND Affect Results?

OR broadens results by allowing any selected language.

AND narrows results by requiring every selected language on each matching book.

### Why Are My Language Filter Results Smaller Than Expected?

Most often, AND is selected or other filters are also active.

Check Active filters and remove strict conditions one by one.

### Can I Update Languages From Book Details Quick Actions?

No. There is no dedicated language quick action on Book Details.

Use Edit Book to change languages.

### Do Language Values Change Sorting?

No. Language values are used for filtering and display, not sort order.

Sorting still follows the selected sort field.

### If a Book Is Deleted and Then Restored, Do Languages Return?

Yes. Restoring the book restores its linked language values.

For restore steps and conflict handling, see [Using the Recycle Bin](/guides/library/recycle-bin).
