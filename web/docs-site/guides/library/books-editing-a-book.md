# Editing a Book

Use this guide when a book already exists and you need to update its information.

It covers the Edit Book page, what is different from adding a new title, and when quick actions are a better fit.

## How You Enter This Page

There is no visible Add mode or Edit mode switch on one screen.

You reach this page in two different ways:

- Add Book: open from Books when creating a new title.
- Edit Book: open from Book Details when updating an existing title.

## When To Use Edit Book

Use Edit Book when you need a broader update in one pass, for example:

- Title, subtitle, ISBN, publication date, or page count changes.
- Language, type, or publisher changes.
- Author, series, and tag updates as part of the same save.

If you only need one quick relationship change, Book Details actions are usually faster.

## What Is Different When Opened as Edit Book

When you open Edit Book from Book Details:

- The ISBN lookup step is hidden.
- Steps start at Step 1: Enter Book Details.
- The copy step is hidden.
- The review button text is Review and Save Changes.
- The confirm button text is Confirm and Save Changes.

## Steps To Edit a Book

1. Open Books.
2. Open the title’s Book Details page.
3. Click Edit Book.
4. Update Step 1: Enter Book Details.
5. Check Step 2: Select Book Type and Step 4: Add Book Publisher.
6. Update links in Step 3: Add Book Authors, Step 5: Add Book Series, and Step 6: Add Book Tags.
7. Click Review and Save Changes.
8. Click Confirm and Save Changes.

## Field Guidance And Validation

Edit Book uses the same field rules as Add Book for shared fields.

- Title: Required, 2 to 255 characters.
- Subtitle: Optional, up to 255 characters.
- ISBN: Optional, valid ISBN-10 or ISBN-13 when filled in.
- Publication Date: Optional, partial dates supported.
- Number of Pages: Optional, whole number 1 to 10000.
- Book Cover Image URL: Optional, valid `http://` or `https://` address.
- Book Description: Optional, up to 2000 characters.
- Author custom role (Other): 2 to 100 characters.
- Series order: Whole number 1 to 10000.
- Tags: 2 to 50 characters, at least one letter, no duplicates on the same book.

For date input examples, see [Using Partial Dates](/guides/library/partial-dates).

## Other Ways To Manage Linked Data

You can also make linked-data changes from:

- Book Details > Manage Authors, Manage Series, Manage Tags.
- Author Details > Books by this author.
- Series Details > Books in this series.

Use Edit Book when several sections need changes together.

Use quick actions when one small change is enough.

## Questions

### What Is the Difference Between Opening Add Book and Opening Edit Book?

Add Book is for creating a new title and includes first-copy entry.

Edit Book is for updating an existing title and does not include first-copy entry.

### Why Don’t I See the ISBN Lookup Step Here?

When the page is opened as Edit Book, the lookup step is hidden.

That keeps the edit process focused on saved book information.

### Where Do I Edit Copies While Updating an Existing Book?

Go back to Book Details and use Add Copy or Edit Copy in the Book Copies section.

Copy maintenance is intentionally outside this page.

### Can I Change ISBN During Edit Book?

Yes. ISBN stays editable.

If the value is invalid, the page shows validation help and blocks save until fixed.

### Can I Change Languages, Type, and Publisher Here?

Yes. These fields are part of the normal Edit Book steps.

Use this page when you need these changes together with other updates.

### Should I Use Manage Tags or the Tag Step Here?

Use Manage Tags when tags are the only change.

Use the tag step here when tags are part of a larger update you are already saving.

### What If I Only Need One Author Role Change?

Book Details > Manage Authors is usually faster for that one change.

Use Edit Book only if the role update is part of a wider pass.

### What Happens After Confirm and Save Changes?

You return to Book Details for that title.

From there, you can do follow-up quick actions if needed.

### Can I Restore a Deleted Book From This Page?

No. Restore is handled from Book Details or from Account > Recycle bin.

You can also find deleted books from Books using Include deleted, then open Book Details and restore.

### What Is the Best Final Check Before Confirming?

Review the sections you changed most, especially linked people, linked series, and dates.

This catches most mistakes before they become harder to trace later.
