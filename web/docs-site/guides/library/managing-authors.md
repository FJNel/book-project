# Managing Authors

This page is the author guide hub. It helps you choose the best page for each author task.

## What Is an Author in The Book Project?

An author is a reusable person profile linked to books with a role such as Author, Editor, Illustrator, or Translator.

## When To Use This Hub

Use this hub when you need to choose between:

- Creating or editing author profiles.
- Updating author links on one book.
- Cleaning up links across one author’s full book list.
- Restoring deleted authors.

## Pick The Right Page

1. Use [Managing Authors (Full Guide)](/guides/library/authors-managing-authors) for full author lifecycle work.
2. Use [Book Details](/guides/library/books-book-details) when one specific book is your focus.
3. Use [Adding a Book](/guides/library/books-adding-a-book) when you are creating a title and its author links together.
4. Use [Editing a Book](/guides/library/books-editing-a-book) when author changes are part of a wider book update.

## You Can Also Do This From

- Authors > open an author > Books by this author for author-first cleanup.
- Book Details > Manage Authors for title-first cleanup.
- Edit Book author step for larger edits done in one pass.

## Delete And Restore Quick Notes

- Delete puts the author in the recycle bin state.
- Restore returns the author to active state.
- Delete permanently is final.

For conflict choices and bulk restore, see [Using the Recycle Bin](/guides/library/recycle-bin).

## Questions

### Which Page Is Faster for One Role Fix?

If you are already on the title, use Book Details > Manage Authors.

If you are already on the person profile, use Books by this author.

### Which Page Is Better for Profile Changes?

Use Author Details for profile updates such as names, dates, and bio.

That page is built for person-level updates across many titles.

### Can I Remove a Link Without Deleting the Author?

Yes. Remove only the link from the author-book actions.

The author profile remains available for other books.

### Where Do I Restore a Deleted Author?

You can restore from Author Details, or from Account > Recycle bin.

You can also find deleted authors from Authors by enabling Include deleted authors.

### Does Author Deletion Remove Books?

No. Book records stay in your library.

Deletion changes author status and links, not book existence.
