# Book Details

Book Details is the main page for working on one specific title.

It brings book information, linked people and lists, copy information, and delete or restore actions into one place.

## What You Can Do on This Page

Use this page when you need to:

- Open full Edit Book for broader updates.
- Make quick linked-data changes with Manage Authors, Manage Series, and Manage Tags.
- Add, edit, or remove copies.
- Delete, restore, or permanently delete the book.

## Steps To Open Book Details

1. Open Books.
2. Click the title row or card you want.
3. You land on that title’s Book Details page.

## Ways To Edit From This Page

### Full Book Update

Click Edit Book when you want one guided pass through book information and links.

### Quick Link Updates

Use these buttons for focused changes:

- Manage Authors.
- Manage Series.
- Manage Tags.

### Copy Updates

Use these copy actions:

- Add Copy.
- Edit Copy.
- Remove Copy.

## You Can Also Manage Linked Data From Other Pages

- Authors can be adjusted from Author Details > Books by this author.
- Series links and series order can be adjusted from Series Details > Books in this series.
- Publisher-linked books can be reviewed from Publisher Details > Books by this publisher.

Choose the page based on where your work starts: one book, one author, one series, or one publisher.

## Delete, Restore, And Permanent Delete

### Delete

Delete moves the book to recycle bin state.

What changes after delete:

- The book is hidden from active-only views.
- The book can still be restored.
- Book Details shows a red Deleted badge and a recycle-bin notice.

### Restore

You can restore from:

- Book Details using Restore.
- Account > Recycle bin.
- Books list by enabling Include deleted, opening the deleted title, then clicking Restore.

If there is a restore conflict, you choose one mode:

- Decline keeps the current active match and leaves the deleted book deleted.
- Merge combines details into the active match where possible.
- Override restores the deleted book over the active match.

For detailed conflict examples, see [Using the Recycle Bin](/guides/library/recycle-bin).

### Delete Permanently

Delete permanently is final and cannot be undone.

You must type `DELETE` to confirm this action.

## Remove Copy: What It Means

Remove Copy permanently removes that copy’s information from your library.

This is not a recycle-bin action for copies.

What to know before you click Remove Copy:

- You cannot restore that removed copy later.
- The page blocks removal if it is the only copy left for that book.
- If you want to keep history, edit the copy fields instead of removing the copy.

For full copy guidance, see [Managing Book Copies](/guides/library/books-managing-copies).

## Questions

### When Should I Use Edit Book Instead of Manage Authors, Manage Series, or Manage Tags?

Use Edit Book when you need a broader pass across several sections at once.

Use the Manage buttons when you want one focused change and want to finish quickly.

### If I Update Authors or Tags Here, Will Books Filters See It?

Yes. After you save, those changes are part of the book and are used by list filters.

If you already have the books list open, refresh it or re-run filters to see updated counts.

### Can I Change Series Order Here?

Yes. Use Manage Series on this page to update order for linked series.

If you are reordering many books in one series, Series Details is usually faster.

### What Happens If I Click Delete by Mistake?

The book goes to recycle-bin state first, so you can restore it.

Open the deleted book and click Restore, or restore it from Account > Recycle bin.

### How Do I Choose Decline, Merge, or Override on Restore?

Start with Decline if you are unsure.

Choose Merge when both rows represent the same title and you want one combined result. Choose Override when the deleted version is the one you trust and want as the final active version.

### Is Remove Copy the Same as Deleting a Book?

No. Remove Copy affects only one copy entry on this title.

Deleting the book affects the whole title.

### Why Can’t I Remove the Last Copy?

The app requires at least one copy to remain on a book record.

Add another copy first, then remove the one you no longer want.

### I Want To Keep Acquisition History but Hide a Copy. What Should I Do?

Do not remove the copy if you still need that history.

Instead, edit notes or move the copy to a suitable location so the history stays available.

### Can I Restore Deleted Books From the Books List?

Yes. Turn on Include deleted in Books, apply, open the deleted title, then click Restore on Book Details.

For multi-item restore, use [Using the Recycle Bin](/guides/library/recycle-bin).

### What Is a Good Final Check Before Leaving Book Details?

Confirm title, linked authors, linked series, and copy locations.

That quick pass catches most mistakes before they spread into list filtering and reports.
