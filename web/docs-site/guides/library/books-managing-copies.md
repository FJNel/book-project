# Managing Book Copies

This guide explains how to manage physical copies from Book Details.

Use it to add copies, update one copy’s information, move copies between locations, or remove a copy you no longer track.

## What Is a Copy?

A copy is one physical item you own for a title.

One book can have many copies. Each copy can have different location and acquisition information.

## When To Use Copy Management

Use copy actions when you need to:

- Add another physical copy of the same title.
- Move one copy to another location.
- Correct acquisition details for one copy.
- Remove a copy you no longer want to track.

## Steps To Manage Copies

1. Open the title’s Book Details page.
2. In Book Copies, click Add Copy, or open Edit Copy on an existing row.
3. Update fields and save.
4. Use Remove Copy only when you truly want to delete that copy entry.

## Copy Fields

### Storage Location (Required)

This is where that physical copy is stored.

If the location is missing, use Add new storage location in the copy window, then select it.

### Acquisition Date (Optional)

Date you obtained this specific copy.

Partial dates are supported. See [Using Partial Dates](/guides/library/partial-dates).

### Acquired From (Optional)

Person, shop, donor, or source.

Validation:

- Up to 255 characters.

### Acquisition Type (Optional)

How you got the copy (for example purchase or gift).

Validation:

- Up to 100 characters.

### Acquisition Location (Optional)

Place where you got the copy.

Validation:

- Up to 255 characters.

### Acquisition Story (Optional)

Longer notes about the copy’s history.

Validation:

- Up to 2000 characters.

### Notes (Optional)

Any extra details for this specific copy.

Validation:

- Up to 2000 characters.

## Remove Copy: Important Behavior

Remove Copy permanently deletes that copy’s information.

Before removing:

- Confirm you do not need that copy’s history anymore.
- Remember this is not recovered through Recycle bin.

Safety rule:

- You cannot remove the final remaining copy of a book.

## Other Ways To Enter First-Copy Information

When creating a new title in Add Book, you enter first-copy information in Step 8: Enter Book Copy Details.

After the title exists, all copy updates happen from Book Details.

## Questions

### Can One Book Have Multiple Copies With Different Details?

Yes. That is the expected setup.

Each copy stores its own location and acquisition information.

### Can I Move One Copy Without Affecting Other Copies?

Yes. Edit only that copy and change its Storage Location.

Other copies remain unchanged.

### What Is the Fastest Way To Fix a Wrong Location?

Open Edit Copy for that row, select the correct location, then save.

Confirm the update in the Book Copies list afterward.

### Can I Add a Copy Without Editing Book Information?

Yes. Copy actions are separate from Edit Book.

You can manage copies without changing title, tags, or links.

### Why Is Remove Copy Disabled?

It is disabled when the book has only one copy left.

Add another copy first, then remove the one you no longer want.

### Is Removed Copy Data Recoverable From Recycle Bin?

No. Recycle bin tracks deleted books and selected library types, not individual copies.

Removing a copy is a permanent action for that copy row.

### Are Partial Dates Allowed for Acquisition Date?

Yes. Acquisition Date supports partial dates and shows help while you type.

See [Using Partial Dates](/guides/library/partial-dates) for accepted formats.

### Can I Create a Storage Location While Editing a Copy?

Yes. Use Add new storage location from the copy window.

After saving the new location, select it and save the copy.

### Where Can I Review Books by Storage Location?

Use [Managing Storage Locations](/guides/library/storage-locations) to view placement and totals by location.

That page helps when you are reorganizing shelves or rooms.

### What Is a Common Mistake With Copy Notes?

Putting title summary text into copy fields.

Keep title summary in the book description, and use copy fields for physical-item history.
