# Updating Your Profile Information

You can update your personal profile information, such as your full name and preferred name in The Book Project. This guide explains how to do so.

## Why Update Your Profile?

Updating your profile information helps personalize your experience in The Book Project. Your full name and preferred name may be used in various parts of the application, such as account settings, notifications, and any administrative communications. 

## How to Update Your Profile

To update your full name and preferred name, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your Book Project account on the [login page](https://bookproject.fjnel.co.za/).
2. Once you're on your [dashboard](https://bookproject.fjnel.co.za/dashboard), click on the "Account" button in the navigation menu.
3. On the Account page, navigate to the "Profile" tab.
4. There you will see a "Profile" section with the current values for your full name and preferred name, along with your email address (which cannot be changed here) and other account details.
5. Click on the "Edit Profile" button to open the profile edit form.
6. The form will have fields for "Full Name" and "Preferred Name", pre-filled with your current information.
7. Update the "Full Name" and/or "Preferred Name" fields with your new information.
8. Click on the "Save changes" button to save your changes.
9. After a few seconds, if your new profile information is valid, you should see a confirmation message indicating that your profile has been successfully updated.

When you update your profile information, a notification email will be sent to your registered email address confirming the changes. 

## Questions

### What information can I update in my profile?
You can update your full name and preferred name in your profile. Your email address cannot be changed here; to change your email address, please refer to the [Changing Your Email Address guide](/guides/changing-your-email). To change your password, please refer to the [Change Your Password guide](/guides/changing-your-password).

### What is the difference between full name and preferred name?
Your full name is your complete legal name, which may be used for official purposes and communications. Your preferred name is the name you would like to be addressed by in informal contexts, such as notifications and user interface elements. It allows for a more personalized experience.

### Do I need to change both fields?
No, you can choose to update either your full name, your preferred name, or both fields as needed. Simply fill in the fields you wish to change and leave the others unchanged. If you leave both fields unchanged, you will not be able to submit the form.

### Can I change my profile information multiple times?
Yes, you can update your profile information as many times as you like. There are no restrictions on how often you can change your full name or preferred name. However, misusing this feature to frequently change your name may lead to usage restrictions or account review by the System Administrator.

### Will updating my profile affect my books or data?
No, updating your profile information will not affect your books or any other data in your Book Project account. Your library data, including books, authors, publishers, and other related information, remains intact and accessible after you update your profile. The profile update only affects your personal information used for identification and communication; it does not modify or delete any of your library data.

### What happens if I leave a field blank?
Your "Full Name" field cannot be left blank; it is a required field. If you attempt to submit the form with an empty "Full Name" field, you will receive an error message prompting you to fill in the required information. Your "Preferred Name" field is optional and can be left blank if you do not wish to set a preferred name. To remove a previously set preferred name, simply clear the field and save your changes.

### I received a notification email about changing my profile, but I didn't make any changes. What should I do?
If you received a notification email about changing your profile but did not make any changes, it is possible that someone else accessed your account and updated your profile information. For your security, we recommend that you take the following steps:
1. Change your password immediately by following the [Change Your Password guide](/guides/changing-your-password).
2. Review your account activity and ensure that no other unauthorized changes have been made.
3. Contact the System Administrator at [support@fjnel.com](mailto:support@fjnel.com?subject=%20Unauthorised%20Profile%20Change%20Notification) for further assistance.

### My old profile information is still showing on some pages. What should I do?
If your old profile information is still showing on some pages after you have updated it, try the following steps:
1. Refresh the page to ensure that the latest information is loaded.
2. Clear your browser cache and cookies, as outdated cached data may cause old information to be displayed.
3. Log out of your account and log back in to ensure that your session is updated with the latest profile information.
If the issue persists after trying these steps, please contact the System Administrator at [support@fjnel.co.za](mailto:support@fjnel.co.za?subject=%20Profile%20Information%20Update%20Issue) for further assistance.

### Can I use special characters in my name fields?
Yes, you can use special characters in both the "Full Name" and "Preferred Name" fields, as long as they are commonly accepted characters for names. However, certain special characters that may interfere with system functionality or security (such as HTML tags or SQL commands) may be restricted. If you attempt to use unsupported characters, you will receive an error message prompting you to correct the input. If you have any questions about specific characters, please contact the System Administrator at [support@fjnel.co.za](mailto:support@fjnel.co.za?subject=%20Special%20Characters%20in%20Name%20Fields) for further assistance.
