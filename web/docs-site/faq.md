# FAQ

This page answers common questions about day-to-day use of The Book Project.

## Questions

### Where do I start after I log in?
Start on the dashboard, then open Books and use Add Book to create your first record.

### Can I use partial dates?
Yes. Book and author workflows accept partial dates in many fields. For example, you can store a year-only value when the full day and month are unknown.

### Why am I asked to type `DELETE` for some actions?
Permanent delete actions require typing `DELETE` to prevent accidental data loss.

### What is the difference between Delete and Delete permanently?
Delete moves records to the recycle bin (soft delete). Delete permanently removes them fully and cannot be undone.

### Can I filter by more than one field at once?
Yes. List pages support combining search, sort, and advanced filters. On Books, multi-select filters such as Authors, Series, Tags, and Languages can use AND or OR matching.

### Why did I return to the login page?
Your session may have expired or become invalid. The app clears the session and redirects to login so you can sign in again.
