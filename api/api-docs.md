# Documentation

Welcome to the Documentation for my project. This document provides an overview of the API and covers authentication, standard response formats, and all available endpoints. It also provides an overview of how databases are structured. You can access databases indirectly using the API.

To interact with the API, you can use tools like Postman or curl, or access it programmatically via HTTP requests.

**API Location:** https://api.fjnel.co.za/  
**API Request and Response Format:** JSON  
**API Request Type:** Depends on the endpoint used (see below for more details)

# Logging

The API uses a hybrid logging approach:

- Significant actions (user registration, login, logout, password reset requests, profile updates, token refresh, email verification events, etc.) are logged in a dedicated database table `user_logs`.
- In addition, all HTTP requests are logged to rotating log files (via a Winston-based logger) with method, path, status, response time, and limited metadata. This is helpful for monitoring and debugging.
- Sensitive information (passwords, tokens, secrets, Authorization headers, etc.) is never logged. Potentially secret-like fields are redacted in both file and DB logs.

# Response Format

All API responses, whether successful or failed, follow a standardised JSON structure. This ensures consistency and makes it easier to handle responses programmatically.

## Success Response

Successful requests will return a `2xx` HTTP status code and a JSON body with the following structure:

```json
{
	"status": "success",
	"httpCode": 200,
	"responseTime": "15.42", // Response time in milliseconds
	"message": "A success message",
	"data": {
		// Contains the requested data (e.g., a user object, a list of books)
	},
	"errors": [] // Always an empty array on success
}
```

## Error Response

Failed requests will return a `4xx` or `5xx` HTTP status code and provide details in the `errors` array.

```json
{
	"status": "error",
	"httpCode": 400,
	"responseTime": "10.01", // Response time in milliseconds
	"message": "A general error message (e.g., 'Validation Error')",
	"data": {}, // Always an empty object on error
	"errors": [
		"Specific error message 1.",
		"Specific error message 2."
  	]
}
```



# Root Endpoint (Health Check)

**Endpoint:** `GET /`
**Access:** Public
**Description:** Returns a welcome message and basic information about the API.

**Example Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "httpCode": 200,
  "responseTime": "1.26",
  "message": "The API is working!",
  "data": {
    "timestamp": "11/09/2025, 09:03:54",
    "api_documentation_url": "https://api.fjnel.co.za/api-docs.html"
  },
  "errors": []
}
```



# Authentication

The `/auth/` route is used for all authentication-related operations, including user registration, login, logout, password reset, and token refresh. 

## Register

**Endpoint:** `POST /auth/register`
**Access:** Public (Rate Limited) (CAPTCHA Protected) (Email Verification Required)
**Description:** Registers a new user in the database.

### Rate Limiting:

To ensure that this endpoint is not abused, it is rate-limited.  
**Limit:** Maximum of 5 requests per IP address every 10 minutes.

### CAPTCHA Protection:

To prevent automated registrations, this endpoint is protected by CAPTCHA. Users must complete a CAPTCHA challenge to successfully register. The `captchaToken` as provided by the client must be included in the request body. 

### Email Verification:

After successful registration, a verification email is issued for the provided email address. The user must verify their email before they can log in. If a registration is attempted with an email that already exists but is not yet verified, the API will (re)send a verification email (reusing an active token if still valid, otherwise creating a new one) and return a success message instead of creating a duplicate account.

### Required Parameters (JSON Body):

Hereâ€™s a clean Markdown table you can paste into your docs:

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description and Details | Default |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------------------|---------|
| `captchaToken` | String | **Yes** | CAPTCHA token from the client-side challenge, used to verify that the request is human. | |
| `fullName` | String | **Yes** | The user's full name. This allows for flexibility in name formats. Must be between 2 and 255 characters. Only alphabetic characters, spaces, hyphens, full stops and apostrophes are allowed. | |
| `preferredName` | String | No | The user's preferred name. This name will be used in UI elements. Must be between 2 and 100 characters. Only alphabetic characters are allowed. | `null` |
| `email` | String | **Yes** | The user's email address which will be used for login. It must be unique. It must be between 5 and 255 characters and follow standard email formatting rules. The user must be able to receive emails at this address. | |
| `password` | String | **Yes** | The user's password. It must be between 10 and 100 characters and include at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character. | |

### Example Request Object
```json
{
	"captchaToken": "<captcha-token-from-client>",
	"fullName": "Jane Doe",
	"preferredName": "Jane",

	"data": {},
	"errors": []
}
```

### Example Error Response (409 Conflict)

Example error when the email is already verified and in use:

```json
